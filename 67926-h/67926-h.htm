<p class="dropcap-first-letter">According to one mode of regarding those two
classes of mental action, which are called reason
and imagination, the former may be considered
as mind contemplating the relations borne by one
thought to another, however produced; and the latter,
as mind acting upon those thoughts so as to colour them
with its own light, and composing from them, as from
elements, other thoughts, each containing within itself
the principle of its own integrity. The one is the τὸ
ποιειν, or the principle of synthesis, and has for its
object those forms which are common to universal
nature and existence itself; the other is the τὸ λογιζειν,
or principle of analysis, and its action regards the
relations of things simply as relations; considering
thoughts, not in their integral unity, but as the algebraical
representations which conduct to certain general
results. Reason is the enumeration of quantities already
known; imagination is the perception of the value of
those quantities, both separately and as a whole. Reason
respects the differences, and imagination the similitudes
of things. Reason is to imagination as the instrument
to the agent, as the body to the spirit, as the shadow to
the substance.</p>

<p>Poetry, in a general sense, may be defined to be “the
expression of the imagination:” and poetry is connate<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
with the origin of man. Man is an instrument over
which a series of external and internal impressions are
driven, like the alternations of an ever-changing wind
over an Æolian lyre, which move it by their motion to
ever-changing melody. But there is a principle within
the human being, and perhaps within all sentient beings,
which acts otherwise than in a lyre, and produces not
melody alone, but harmony, by an internal adjustment
of the sounds and motions thus excited to the impressions
which excite them. It is as if the lyre could accommodate
its chords to the motions of that which strikes
them, in a determined proportion of sound; even as the
musician can accommodate his voice to the sound of the
lyre. A child at play by itself will express its delight by
its voice and motions; and every inflexion of tone and
gesture will bear exact relation to a corresponding anti-type
in the pleasurable impressions which awakened
it; it will be the reflected image of that impression;
and as the lyre trembles and sounds after the wind has
died away, so the child seeks, by prolonging in its voice
and motions the duration of the effect, to prolong also a
consciousness of the cause. In relation to the objects
which delight a child, these expressions are what poetry
is to higher objects. The savage (for the savage is to
ages what the child is to years) expresses the emotions
produced in him by surrounding objects in a similar
manner; and language and gesture, together with plastic
or pictorial imitation, become the image of the combined
effect of those objects and his apprehension of
them. Man in society, with all his passions and his
pleasures, next becomes the object of the passions and
pleasures of man; an additional class of emotions
produces an augmented treasure of expression; and
language, gesture, and the imitative arts become at
once the representation and the medium, the pencil and
the picture, the chisel and the statue, the chord and
the harmony. The social sympathies, or those laws
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
from which as from its elements society results, begin
to develop themselves from the moment that two human
beings coexist; the future is contained within the
present as the plant within the seed; and equality,
diversity, unity, contrast, mutual dependence, become
the principles alone capable of affording the motives
according to which the will of a social being is determined
to action, inasmuch as he is social; and constitute
pleasure in sensation, virtue in sentiment, beauty in art,
truth in reasoning, and love in the intercourse of kind.
Hence men, even in the infancy of society, observe a
certain order in their words and actions, distinct from
that of the objects and the impressions represented by
them, all expression being subject to the laws of that
from which it proceeds. But let us dismiss those more
general considerations which might involve an inquiry
into the principles of society itself, and restrict our view
to the manner in which the imagination is expressed
upon its forms.</p>

<p>In the youth of the world, men dance and sing and
imitate natural objects, observing in these actions, as in
all others, a certain rhythm or order. And, although
all men observe a similar, they observe not the same
order, in the motions of the dance, in the melody of the
song, in the combinations of language, in the series of
their imitations of natural objects. For there is a certain
order or rhythm belonging to each of these classes
of mimetic representation, from which the hearer and
the spectator receive an intenser and purer pleasure
than from any other: the sense of an approximation to
this order has been called taste by modern writers.
Every man in the infancy of art, observes an order which
approximates more or less closely to that from which
this highest delight results: but the diversity is not
sufficiently marked, as that its gradations should be
sensible, except in those instances where the predominance
of this faculty of approximation to the beautiful
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
(for so we may be permitted to name the relation
between this highest pleasure and its cause) is very
great. Those in whom it exists to excess are poets, in
the most universal sense of the word; and the pleasure
resulting from the manner in which they express the
influence of society or nature upon their own minds,
communicates itself to others, and gathers a sort of
reduplication from the community. Their language is
vitally metaphorical; that is, it marks the before unapprehended
relations of things and perpetuates their
apprehension, until words, which represent them, become,
through time, signs for portions or classes of thought,
instead of pictures of integral thoughts; and then, if
no new poets should arise to create afresh the associations
which have been thus disorganised, language will
be dead to all the nobler purposes of human intercourse.
These similitudes or relations are finely said by
Bacon to be “the same footsteps of nature impressed
upon the various subjects of the world;”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>&mdash;and he considers
the faculty which perceives them as the storehouse
of axioms common to all knowledge. In the
infancy of society every author is necessarily a poet,
because language itself is poetry; and to be a poet is to
apprehend the true and the beautiful, in a word, the good
which exists in the relation subsisting, first between
existence and perception, and secondly between perception
and expression. Every original language near
to its source is in itself the chaos of a cyclic poem:
the copiousness of lexicography and the distinctions of
grammar are the works of a later age, and are merely
the catalogue and the form of the creations of poetry.</p>

<p>But poets, or those who imagine and express this
indestructible order, are not only the authors of language
and of music, of the dance, and architecture, and statuary,
and painting; they are the institutors of laws and<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
the founders of civil society, and the inventors of the
arts of life, and the teachers, who draw into a certain
propinquity with the beautiful and the true, that partial
apprehension of the agencies of the invisible world which
is called religion. Hence all original religions are
allegorical or susceptible of allegory, and, like Janus,
have a double face of false and true. Poets, according
to the circumstances of the age and nation in which
they appeared, were called, in the earlier epochs of the
world, legislators or prophets: a poet essentially comprises
and unites both these characters. For he not
only beholds intensely the present as it is, and discovers
those laws according to which present things ought to be
ordered, but he beholds the future in the present, and
his thoughts are the germs of the flower and the fruit of
latest time. Not that I assert poets to be prophets in
the gross sense of the word, or that they can foretell the
form as surely as they foreknow the spirit of events:
such is the pretence of superstition, which would make
poetry an attribute of prophecy, rather than prophecy an
attribute of poetry. A poet participates in the eternal,
the infinite, and the one; as far as relates to his conceptions,
time and place and number are not. The
grammatical forms which express the moods of time,
and the difference of persons, and the distinction of
place, are convertible with respect to the highest poetry
without injuring it as poetry; and the choruses of
Æschylus, and the book of Job, and Dante’s <i>Paradiso</i>,
would afford, more than any other writings, examples of
this fact, if the limits of this essay did not forbid citation.
The creations of sculpture, painting, and music, are illustrations
still more decisive.</p>

<p>Language, colour, form, and religious and civil habits
of action, are all the instruments and materials of poetry;
they may be called poetry by that figure of speech
which considers the effect as a synonym of the cause.
But poetry in a more restricted sense expresses those<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
arrangements of language, and especially metrical language,
which are created by that imperial faculty, whose
throne is curtained within the invisible nature of man.
And this springs from the nature itself of language,
which is a more direct representation of the actions and
passions of our internal being, and is susceptible of more
various and delicate combinations, than colour, form, or
motion, and is more plastic and obedient to the control
of that faculty of which it is the creation. For language
is arbitrarily produced by the imagination, and has
relation to thoughts alone; but all other materials,
instruments, and conditions of art, have relations among
each other, which limit and interpose between conception
and expression. The former is as a mirror
which reflects, the latter as a cloud which enfeebles,
the light of which both are mediums of communication.
Hence the fame of sculptors, painters, and musicians,
although the intrinsic powers of the great masters of
these arts may yield in no degree to that of those who
have employed language as the hieroglyphic of their
thoughts, has never equalled that of poets in the
restricted sense of the term; as two performers of
equal skill will produce unequal effects from a guitar
and a harp. The fame of legislators and founders of
religion, so long as their institutions last, alone seems
to exceed that of poets in the restricted sense; but it
can scarcely be a question, whether, if we deduct the
celebrity which their flattery of the gross opinions of
the vulgar usually conciliates, together with that which
belonged to them in their higher character of poets, any
excess will remain.</p>

<p>We have thus circumscribed the word poetry within
the limits of that art which is the most familiar and
the most perfect expression of the faculty itself. It is
necessary, however, to make the circle still narrower,
and to determine the distinction between measured
and unmeasured language; for the popular division<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
into prose and verse is inadmissible in accurate philosophy.</p>

<p>Sounds as well as thoughts have relation both between
each other and towards that which they represent,
and a perception of the order of those relations
has always been found connected with a perception of
the order of the relations of thought. Hence the
language of poets has ever affected a sort of uniform
and harmonious recurrence of sound, without which it
were not poetry, and which is scarcely less indispensable
to the communication of its influence, than the words
themselves, without reference to that peculiar order.
Hence the vanity of translation; it were as wise to cast
a violet into a crucible that you might discover the
formal principle of its colour and odour, as seek to
transfuse from one language into another the creations
of a poet. The plant must spring again from its seed,
or it will bear no flower&mdash;and this is the burthen of the
curse of Babel.</p>

<p>An observation of the regular mode of the recurrence
of harmony in the language of poetical minds, together
with its relation to music, produced metre, or a certain
system of traditional forms of harmony and language.
Yet it is by no means essential that a poet should
accommodate his language to this traditional form, so
that the harmony, which is its spirit, be observed. The
practice is indeed convenient and popular, and to be
preferred, especially in such composition as includes
much action: but every great poet must inevitably
innovate upon the example of his predecessors in the
exact structure of his peculiar versification. The distinction
between poets and prose-writers is a vulgar
error. The distinction between philosophers and poets
has been anticipated. Plato was essentially a poet&mdash;the
truth and splendour of his imagery, and the melody
of his language, are the most intense that it is possible
to conceive. He rejected the harmony of the epic,<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
dramatic, and lyrical forms, because he sought to kindle
a harmony in thoughts divested of shape and action,
and he forbore to invent any regular plan of rhythm
which would include, under determinate forms, the
varied pauses of his style. Cicero sought to imitate
the cadence of his periods, but with little success.
Bacon was a poet.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> His language has a sweet and
majestic rhythm, which satisfies the sense, no less
than the almost superhuman wisdom of his philosophy
satisfies the intellect; it is a strain which distends, and
then bursts the circumference of the reader’s mind, and
pours itself forth together with it into the universal
element with which it has perpetual sympathy. All the
authors of revolutions in opinion are not only necessarily
poets as they are inventors, nor even as their words
unveil the permanent analogy of things by images which
participate in the life of truth; but as their periods are
harmonious and rhythmical, and contain in themselves
the elements of verse; being the echo of the eternal
music. Nor are those supreme poets, who have employed
traditional forms of rhythm on account of the
form and action of their subjects, less capable of perceiving
and teaching the truth of things, than those who
have omitted that form. Shakespeare, Dante, and
Milton (to confine ourselves to modern writers) are
philosophers of the very loftiest power.</p>

<p>A poem is the very image of life expressed in its
eternal truth. There is this difference between a story
and a poem, that a story is a catalogue of detached
facts, which have no other connexion than time, place,
circumstance, cause, and effect; the other is the creation
of actions according to the unchangeable forms of human
nature, as existing in the mind of the Creator, which is
itself the image of all other minds. The one is partial,
and applies only to a definite period of time, and a certain<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
combination of events which can never again recur;
the other is universal, and contains within itself the
germ of a relation to whatever motives or actions have
place in the possible varieties of human nature. Time,
which destroys the beauty and the use of the story of
particular facts, stripped of the poetry which should
invest them, augments that of poetry, and for ever
develops new and wonderful applications of the eternal
truth which it contains. Hence epitomes have been
called the moths of just history; they eat out the poetry
of it. A story of particular facts is as a mirror which
obscures and distorts that which should be beautiful:
poetry is a mirror which makes beautiful that which is
distorted.</p>

<p>The parts of a composition may be poetical, without
the composition as a whole being a poem. A single
sentence may be considered as a whole, though it may
be found in the midst of a series of unassimilated
portions; a single word even may be a spark of inextinguishable
thought. And thus all the great historians,
Herodotus, Plutarch, Livy, were poets; and although
the plan of these writers, especially that of Livy, restrained
them from developing this faculty in its highest
degree, they made copious and ample amends for their
subjection, by filling all the interstices of their subjects
with living images.</p>

<p>Having determined what is poetry, and who are poets,
let us proceed to estimate its effects upon society.</p>

<p>Poetry is ever accompanied with pleasure: all spirits
upon which it falls open themselves to receive the
wisdom which is mingled with its delight. In the
infancy of the world, neither poets themselves nor their
auditors are fully aware of the excellence of poetry: for
it acts in a divine and unapprehended manner, beyond
and above consciousness; and it is reserved for future
generations to contemplate and measure the mighty
cause and effect in all the strength and splendour of<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
their union. Even in modern times, no living poet ever
arrived at the fulness of his fame; the jury which sits
in judgment upon a poet, belonging as he does to all
time, must be composed of his peers: it must be
empannelled by time from the selectest of the wise of
many generations. A poet is a nightingale, who sits
in darkness and sings to cheer its own solitude with
sweet sounds; his auditors are as men entranced by
the melody of an unseen musician, who feel that they
are moved and softened, yet know not whence or why.
The poems of Homer and his contemporaries were the
delight of infant Greece; they were the elements of
that social system which is the column upon which all
succeeding civilisation has reposed. Homer embodied
the ideal perfection of his age in human character; nor
can we doubt that those who read his verses were
awakened to an ambition of becoming like to Achilles,
Hector, and Ulysses: the truth and beauty of friendship,
patriotism, and persevering devotion to an object, were
unveiled to their depths in these immortal creations:
the sentiments of the auditors must have been refined
and enlarged by a sympathy with such great and lovely
impersonations, until from admiring they imitated, and
from imitation they identified themselves with the objects
of their admiration. Nor let it be objected, that these
characters are remote from moral perfection, and that
they are by no means to be considered as edifying
patterns for general imitation. Every epoch, under
names more or less specious, has deified its peculiar
errors; Revenge is the naked idol of the worship of a
semibarbarous age; and Self-deceit is the veiled image
of unknown evil, before which luxury and satiety lie
prostrate. But a poet considers the vices of his contemporaries
as the temporary dress in which his
creations must be arrayed, and which cover without
concealing the eternal proportions of their beauty. An
epic or dramatic personage is understood to wear<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
them around his soul, as he may the ancient armour or
modern uniform around his body; whilst it is easy to
conceive a dress more graceful than either. The beauty
of the internal nature cannot be so far concealed by its
accidental vesture, but that the spirit of its form shall
communicate itself to the very disguise, and indicate
the shape it hides from the manner in which it is worn.
A majestic form and graceful motions will express
themselves through the most barbarous and tasteless
costume. Few poets of the highest class have chosen
to exhibit the beauty of their conceptions in its naked
truth and splendour; and it is doubtful whether the
alloy of costume, habit, &amp;c., be not necessary to temper
this planetary music for mortal ears.</p>

<p>The whole objection, however, of the immorality of
poetry rests upon a misconception of the manner in
which poetry acts to produce the moral improvement of
man. Ethical science arranges the elements which
poetry has created, and propounds schemes and proposes
examples of civil and domestic life: nor is it for
want of admirable doctrines that men hate, and despise,
and censure, and deceive, and subjugate one another.
But poetry acts in another and diviner manner. It
awakens and enlarges the mind itself by rendering it
the receptacle of a thousand unapprehended combinations
of thought. Poetry lifts the veil from the hidden
beauty of the world, and makes familiar objects be as
if they were not familiar; it reproduces all that it represents,
and the impersonations clothed in its Elysian
light stand thenceforward in the minds of those who
have once contemplated them, as memorials of that
gentle and exalted content which extends itself over all
thoughts and actions with which it coexists. The great
secret of morals is love; or a going out of our own
nature, and an identification of ourselves with the
beautiful which exists in thought, action, or person, not
our own. A man, to be greatly good, must imagine<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
intensely and comprehensively; he must put himself in
the place of another and of many others; the pains and
pleasures of his species must become his own. The
great instrument of moral good is the imagination;
and poetry administers to the effect by acting upon
the cause. Poetry enlarges the circumference of the
imagination by replenishing it with thoughts of ever new
delight, which have the power of attracting and assimilating
to their own nature all other thoughts, and which
form new intervals and interstices whose void for ever
craves fresh food. Poetry strengthens the faculty which
is the organ of the moral nature of man, in the same
manner as exercise strengthens a limb. A poet therefore
would do ill to embody his own conceptions of right and
wrong, which are usually those of his place and time, in
his poetical creations, which participate in neither. By
this assumption of the inferior office of interpreting
the effect, in which perhaps after all he might acquit
himself but imperfectly, he would resign a glory in the
participation of the cause. There was little danger
that Homer, or any of the eternal poets, should have
so far misunderstood themselves as to have abdicated
this throne of their widest dominion. Those in whom
the poetical faculty, though great, is less intense, as
Euripides, Lucan, Tasso, Spenser, have frequently
affected a moral aim, and the effect of their poetry is
diminished in exact proportion to the degree in which
they compel us to advert to this purpose.</p>

<p>Homer and the cyclic poets were followed at a certain
interval by the dramatic and lyrical poets of Athens,
who flourished contemporaneously with all that is most
perfect in the kindred expressions of the poetical faculty;
architecture, painting, music, the dance, sculpture, philosophy,
and we may add, the forms of civil life. For
although the scheme of Athenian society was deformed
by many imperfections which the poetry existing in
chivalry and Christianity has erased from the habits<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
and institutions of modern Europe; yet never at any
other period has so much energy, beauty and virtue,
been developed; never was blind strength and stubborn
form so disciplined and rendered subject to the will of
man, or that will less repugnant to the dictates of the
beautiful and the true, as during the century which
preceded the death of Socrates. Of no other epoch in
the history of our species have we records and fragments
stamped so visibly with the image of the divinity
in man. But it is poetry alone, in form, in action, and
in language, which has rendered this epoch memorable
above all others, and the storehouse of examples to
everlasting time. For written poetry existed at that
epoch simultaneously with the other arts, and it is an
idle inquiry to demand which gave and which received
the light, which all, as from a common focus, have
scattered over the darkest periods of succeeding time.
We know no more of cause and effect than a constant
conjunction of events: poetry is ever found to co-exist
with whatever other arts contribute to the happiness and
perfection of man. I appeal to what has already been
established to distinguish between the cause and the
effect.</p>

<p>It was at the period here adverted to, that the drama
had its birth; and however a succeeding writer may
have equalled or surpassed those few great specimens of
the Athenian drama which have been preserved to us, it
is indisputable that the art itself never was understood
or practised according to the true philosophy of it, as at
Athens. For the Athenians employed language, action,
music, painting, the dance, and religious institutions, to
produce a common effect in the representation of the
highest idealisms of passion and of power; each division
in the art was made perfect in its kind by artists of
the most consummate skill, and was disciplined into
a beautiful proportion and unity one towards the other.
On the modern stage a few only of the elements capable<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
of expressing the image of the poet’s conception are employed
at once. We have tragedy without music and
dancing; and music and dancing without the highest
impersonations of which they are the fit accompaniment,
and both without religion and solemnity. Religious
institution has indeed been usually banished from the
stage. Our system of divesting the actor’s face of a
mask, on which the many expressions appropriated to
his dramatic character might be moulded into one
permanent and unchanging expression, is favourable
only to a partial and inharmonious effect; it is fit for
nothing but a monologue, where all the attention may
be directed to some great master of ideal mimicry.
The modern practice of blending comedy with tragedy,
though liable to great abuse in point of practice, is
undoubtedly an extension of the dramatic circle; but
the comedy should be as in King Lear, universal, ideal,
and sublime. It is perhaps the intervention of this
principle which determines the balance in favour of
King Lear against the Œdipus Tyrannus or the
Agamemnon, or, if you will, the trilogies with which
they are connected; unless the intense power of the
choral poetry, especially that of the latter, should be
considered as restoring the equilibrium. King Lear, if
it can sustain this comparison, may be judged to be the
most perfect specimen of the dramatic art existing in
the world; in spite of the narrow conditions to which
the poet was subjected by the ignorance of the philosophy
of the drama which has prevailed in modern Europe.
Calderon, in his religious Autos, has attempted to fulfil
some of the high conditions of dramatic representation
neglected by Shakespeare; such as the establishing a
relation between the drama and religion, and the accommodating
them to music and dancing; but he omits the
observation of conditions still more important, and more
is lost than gained by the substitution of the rigidly-defined
and ever-repeated idealisms of a distorted<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
superstition for the living impersonations of the truth of
human passions.</p>

<p>But I digress.&mdash;The connexion of scenic exhibitions
with the improvement or corruption of the manners
of men, has been universally recognised: in other
words, the presence or absence of poetry, in its most
perfect and universal form, has been found to be connected
with good and evil in conduct or habit. The
corruption which has been imputed to the drama as
an effect, begins, when the poetry employed in its
constitution ends: I appeal to the history of manners
whether the periods of the growth of the one and the
decline of the other have not corresponded with an
exactness equal to any example of moral cause and
effect.</p>

<p>The drama at Athens, or wheresoever else it may
have approached to its perfection, ever co-existed with
the moral and intellectual greatness of the age. The
tragedies of the Athenian poets are as mirrors in which
the spectator beholds himself, under a thin disguise
of circumstance, stript of all but that ideal perfection
and energy which every one feels to be the internal
type of all that he loves, admires, and would become.
The imagination is enlarged by a sympathy with pains
and passions so mighty, that they distend in their conception
the capacity of that by which they are conceived,
the good affections are strengthened by pity, indignation,
terror and sorrow; and an exalted calm is prolonged
from the satiety of this high exercise of them into the
tumult of familiar life: even crime is disarmed of half
its horror and all its contagion by being represented as
the fatal consequence of the unfathomable agencies of
nature; error is thus divested of its wilfulness; men
can no longer cherish it as the creation of their choice.
In the drama of the highest order there is little food for
censure or hatred; it teaches rather self-knowledge and
self-respect. Neither the eye nor the mind can see itself,<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
unless reflected upon that which it resembles. The
drama, so long as it continues to express poetry, is a
prismatic and many-sided mirror, which collects the
brightest rays of human nature and divides and reproduces
them from the simplicity of these elementary
forms, and touches them with majesty and beauty, and
multiplies all that it reflects, and endows it with the
power of propagating its like wherever it may fall.</p>

<p>But in periods of the decay of social life, the drama
sympathises with that decay. Tragedy becomes a cold
imitation of the form of the great masterpieces of antiquity,
divested of all harmonious accompaniment of the
kindred arts; and often the very form misunderstood,
or a weak attempt to teach certain doctrines, which the
writer considers as moral truths; and which are usually
no more than specious flatteries of some gross vice or
weakness, with which the author, in common with his
auditors, are infected. Hence what has been called
the classical and domestic drama. Addison’s “Cato”
is a specimen of the one; and would it were not superfluous
to cite examples of the other! To such purposes
poetry cannot be made subservient. Poetry is a sword
of lightning, ever unsheathed, which consumes the
scabbard that would contain it. And thus we observe
that all dramatic writings of this nature are unimaginative
in a singular degree; they affect sentiment and
passion, which, divested of imagination, are other names
for caprice and appetite. The period in our own history
of the grossest degradation of the drama is the reign of
Charles II., when all forms in which poetry had been
accustomed to be expressed became hymns to the
triumph of kingly power over liberty and virtue. Milton
stood alone illuminating an age unworthy of him. At
such periods the calculating principle pervades all the
forms of dramatic exhibition, and poetry ceases to be
expressed upon them. Comedy loves its ideal universality:
wit succeeds to humour; we laugh from self-complacency<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
and triumph, instead of pleasure; malignity,
sarcasm, and contempt succeed to sympathetic merriment;
we hardly laugh, but we smile. Obscenity, which
is ever blasphemy against the divine beauty in life,
becomes, from the very veil which it assumes, more
active if less disgusting: it is a monster for which the
corruption of society for ever brings forth new food,
which it devours in secret.</p>

<p>The drama being that form under which a greater
number of modes of expression of poetry are susceptible
of being combined than any other, the connexion of
poetry and social good is more observable in the drama
than in whatever other form. And it is indisputable
that the highest perfection of human society has ever
corresponded with the highest dramatic excellence; and
that the corruption or the extinction of the drama in
a nation where it has once flourished, is a mark of a
corruption of manners, and an extinction of the energies
which sustain the soul of social life. But, as
Macchiavelli says of political institutions, that life may
be preserved and renewed, if men should arise capable
of bringing back the drama to its principles. And this
is true with respect to poetry in its most extended
sense: all language, institution and form require not
only to be produced but to be sustained: the office and
character of a poet participates in the divine nature as
regards providence, no less than as regards creation.</p>

<p>Civil war, the spoils of Asia, and the fatal predominance
first of the Macedonian, and then of the Roman
arms, were so many symbols of the extinction or suspension
of the creative faculty in Greece. The bucolic
writers, who found patronage under the lettered tyrants
of Sicily and Egypt, were the latest representatives
of its most glorious reign. Their poetry is intensely
melodious; like the odour of the tuberose, it overcomes
and sickens the spirit with excess of sweetness; whilst
the poetry of the preceding age was as a meadow-gale<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
of June, which mingles the fragrance of all the flowers
of the field, and adds a quickening and harmonising
spirit of its own which endows the sense with a power
of sustaining its extreme delight. The bucolic and
erotic delicacy in written poetry is correlative with that
softness in statuary, music, and the kindred arts, and
even in manners and institutions, which distinguished
the epoch to which I now refer. Nor is it the poetical
faculty itself, or any misapplication of it, to which this
want of harmony is to be imputed. An equal sensibility
to the influence of the senses and the affections is to be
found in the writings of Homer and Sophocles: the
former, especially, has clothed sensual and pathetic
images with irresistible attractions. The superiority in
these to succeeding writers consists in the presence of
those thoughts which belong to the inner faculties of our
nature, not in the absence of those which are connected
with the external: their incomparable perfection consists
in a harmony of the union of all. It is not what the
erotic poets have, but what they have not, in which
their imperfection consists. It is not inasmuch as they
were poets, but inasmuch as they were not poets, that
they can be considered with any plausibility as connected
with the corruption of their age. Had that
corruption availed so as to extinguish in them the
sensibility to pleasure, passion, and natural scenery,
which is imputed to them as an imperfection, the last
triumph of evil would have been achieved. For the
end of social corruption is to destroy all sensibility to
pleasure; and, therefore, it is corruption. It begins at
the imagination and the intellect as at the core, and
distributes itself thence as a paralysing venom, through
the affections into the very appetites, until all become
a torpid mass in which hardly sense survives. At the
approach of such a period, poetry ever addresses itself
to those faculties which are the last to be destroyed,
and its voice is heard, like the footsteps of Astræa,<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
departing from the world. Poetry ever communicates
all the pleasure which men are capable of receiving: it
is ever still the light of life; the source of whatever of
beautiful or generous or true can have place in an evil
time. It will readily be confessed that those among
the luxurious citizens of Syracuse and Alexandria, who
were delighted with the poems of Theocritus, were less
cold, cruel, and sensual than the remnant of their tribe.
But corruption must utterly have destroyed the fabric
of human society before poetry can ever cease. The
sacred links of that chain have never been entirely
disjoined, which descending through the minds of many
men is attached to those great minds, whence as from
a magnet the invisible effluence is sent forth, which at
once connects, animates, and sustains the life of all.
It is the faculty which contains within itself the seeds
at once of its own and of social renovation. And let us
not circumscribe the effects of the bucolic and erotic
poetry within the limits of the sensibility of those to
whom it was addressed. They may have perceived the
beauty of those immortal compositions, simply as fragments
and isolated portions: those who are more finely
organised, or born in a happier age, may recognise
them as episodes to that great poem, which all poets,
like the co-operating thoughts of one great mind, have
built up since the beginning of the world.</p>

<p>The same revolutions within a narrower sphere had
place in ancient Rome; but the actions and forms of its
social life never seem to have been perfectly saturated
with the poetical element. The Romans appear to have
considered the Greeks as the selectest treasuries of the
selectest forms of manners and of nature, and to have
abstained from creating in measured language, sculpture,
music, or architecture, any thing which might bear
a particular relation to their own condition, whilst it
should bear a general one to the universal constitution
of the world. But we judge from partial evidence, and<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
we judge perhaps partially. Ennius, Varro, Pacuvius,
and Accius, all great poets, have been lost. Lucretius
is in the highest, and Virgil in a very high sense, a
creator. The chosen delicacy of expressions of the
latter are as a mist of light which conceal from us the
intense and exceeding truth of his conceptions of nature.
Livy is instinct with poetry. Yet Horace, Catullus,
Ovid, and generally the other great writers of the
Virgilian age, saw man and nature in the mirror of
Greece. The institutions also, and the religion of
Rome, were less poetical than those of Greece, as the
shadow is less vivid than the substance. Hence poetry
in Rome seemed to follow, rather than accompany, the
perfection of political and domestic society. The true
poetry of Rome lived in its institutions; for whatever of
beautiful, true, and majestic, they contained, could have
sprung only from the faculty which creates the order in
which they consist. The life of Camillus, the death
of Regulus; the expectation of the senators, in their
godlike state, of the victorious Gauls; the refusal of the
republic to make peace with Hannibal, after the battle
of Cannæ, were not the consequences of a refined calculation
of the probable personal advantage to result from
such a rhythm and order in the shows of life, to those
who were at once the poets and the actors of these
immortal dramas. The imagination beholding the
beauty of this order, created it out of itself according
to its own idea; the consequence was empire, and the
reward everlasting fame. These things are not the less
poetry, <i>quia carent vate sacro</i>. They are the episodes
of that cyclic poem written by Time upon the memories
of men. The Past, like an inspired rhapsodist, fills
the theatre of everlasting generations with their harmony.</p>

<p>At length the ancient system of religion and manners
had fulfilled the circle of its evolutions. And the world
would have fallen into utter anarchy and darkness, but<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
that there were found poets among the authors of the
Christian and chivalric systems of manners and religion,
who created forms of opinion and action never before
conceived; which, copied into the imaginations of men,
became as generals to the bewildered armies of their
thoughts. It is foreign to the present purpose to touch
upon the evil produced by these systems: except that
we protest, on the ground of the principles already
established, that no portion of it can be attributed to
the poetry they contain.</p>

<p>It is probable that the poetry of Moses, Job, David,
Solomon, and Isaiah, had produced a great effect upon
the mind of Jesus and his disciples. The scattered
fragments preserved to us by the biographers of this
extraordinary person are all instinct with the most
vivid poetry. But his doctrines seem to have been
quickly distorted. At a certain period after the prevalence
of a system of opinions founded upon those
promulgated by him, the three forms into which Plato
had distributed the faculties of mind underwent a sort
of apotheosis, and became the object of the worship of
the civilised world. Here it is to be confessed that
“Light seems to thicken,” and</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>But mark how beautiful an order has sprung from the
dust and blood of this fierce chaos! how the world, as
from a resurrection, balancing itself on the golden wings
of knowledge and of hope, has reassumed its yet unwearied
flight into the heaven of time. Listen to the
music, unheard by outward ears, which is as a ceaseless
and invisible wind, nourishing its everlasting course
with strength and swiftness.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>
<p>The poetry in the doctrines of Jesus, and the mythology
and institutions of the Celtic conquerors of the
Roman empire, outlived the darkness and the convulsions
connected with their growth and victory, and
blended themselves in a new fabric of manners and
opinion. It is an error to impute the ignorance of the
dark ages to the Christian doctrines or the predominance
of the Celtic nations. Whatever of evil their agencies
may have contained sprang from the extinction of the
poetical principle, connected with the progress of despotism
and superstition. Men, from causes too intricate
to be here discussed, had become insensible and selfish:
their own will had become feeble, and yet they were its
slaves, and thence the slaves of the will of others: but
fear, avarice, cruelty, and fraud, characterised a race
amongst whom no one was to be found capable of
<i>creating</i> in form, language, or institution. The moral
anomalies of such a state of society are not justly to be
charged upon any class of events immediately connected
with them, and those events are most entitled to our
approbation which could dissolve it most expeditiously.
It is unfortunate for those who cannot distinguish words
from thoughts, that many of these anomalies have been
incorporated into our popular religion.</p>

<p>It was not until the eleventh century that the effects
of the poetry of the Christian and chivalric systems
began to manifest themselves. The principle of equality
had been discovered and applied by Plato in his Republic,
as the theoretical rule of the mode in which the materials
of pleasure and of power, produced by the common skill
and labour of human beings, ought to be distributed
among them. The limitations of this rule were asserted
by him to be determined only by the sensibility of each,
or the utility to result to all. Plato, following the
doctrines of Timæus and Pythagoras, taught also a
moral and intellectual system of doctrine, comprehending
at once the past, the present, and the future condition<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
of man. Jesus divulged the sacred and eternal
truths contained in these views to mankind, and
Christianity, in its abstract purity, became the exoteric
expression of the esoteric doctrines of the poetry and
wisdom of antiquity. The incorporation of the Celtic
nations with the exhausted population of the south,
impressed upon it the figure of the poetry existing in
their mythology and institutions. The result was a sum
of the action and reaction of all the causes included in
it; for it may be assumed as a maxim that no nation
or religion can supersede any other without incorporating
into itself a portion of that which it supersedes.
The abolition of personal and domestic slavery, and the
emancipation of women from a great part of the degrading
restraints of antiquity, were among the consequences
of these events.</p>

<p>The abolition of personal slavery is the basis of the
highest political hope that it can enter into the mind of
man to conceive. The freedom of women produced the
poetry of sexual love. Love became a religion, the
idols of whose worship were ever present. It was as if
the statues of Apollo and the Muses had been endowed
with life and motion, and had walked forth among their
worshippers; so that earth became peopled by the
inhabitants of a diviner world. The familiar appearance
and proceedings of life became wonderful and
heavenly, and a paradise was created as out of the
wrecks of Eden. And as this creation itself is poetry,
so its creators were poets; and language was the
instrument of their art: “Galeotto fù il libro, e chi lo
scrisse.” The Provençal Trouveurs, or inventors, preceded
Petrarch, whose verses are as spells, which
unseal the inmost enchanted fountains of the delight
which is in the grief of love. It is impossible to feel
them without becoming a portion of that beauty which
we contemplate: it were superfluous to explain how the
gentleness and elevation of mind connected with these<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
sacred emotions can render men more amiable, more
generous and wise, and lift them out of the dull vapours
of the little world of self. Dante understood the secret
things of love even more than Petrarch. His <i>Vita
Nuova</i> is an inexhaustible fountain of purity of sentiment
and language: it is the idealised history of that
period, and those intervals of his life which were dedicated
to love. His apotheosis to Beatrice in Paradise,
and the gradations of his own love and her loveliness,
by which as by steps he feigns himself to have ascended
to the throne of the Supreme Cause, is the most glorious
imagination of modern poetry. The acutest critics have
justly reversed the judgment of the vulgar, and the order
of the great acts of the “Divina Commedia,” in the
measure of the admiration which they accord to the
Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise. The latter is a perpetual
hymn of everlasting love. Love, which found
a worthy poet in Plato alone of all the ancients, has
been celebrated by a chorus of the greatest writers of
the renovated world; and the music has penetrated
the caverns of society, and its echoes still drown the
dissonance of arms and superstition. At successive
intervals, Ariosto, Tasso, Shakespeare, Spenser, Calderon,
Rousseau, and the great writers of our own
age, have celebrated the dominion of love, planting as
it were trophies in the human mind of that sublimest
victory over sensuality and force. The true relation
borne to each other by the sexes into which human
kind is distributed, has become less misunderstood;
and if the error which confounded diversity with
inequality of the powers of the two sexes has been
partially recognised in the opinions and institutions of
modern Europe, we owe this great benefit to the
worship of which chivalry was the law, and poets the
prophets.</p>

<p>The poetry of Dante may be considered as the bridge
thrown over the stream of time, which unites the modern<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
and ancient world. The distorted notions of invisible
things which Dante and his rival Milton have idealised,
are merely the mask and the mantle in which these
great poets walk through eternity enveloped and disguised.
It is a difficult question to determine how far
they were conscious of the distinction which must have
subsisted in their minds between their own creeds and
that of the people. Dante at least appears to wish to
mark the full extent of it by placing Riphæus, whom
Virgil calls <i>justissimus unus</i>, in Paradise, and observing
a most poetical caprice in his distribution of rewards
and punishments. And Milton’s poem contains within
itself a philosophical refutation of that system of which,
by a strange and natural antithesis, it has been a chief
popular support. Nothing can exceed the energy and
magnificence of the character of Satan as expressed
in “Paradise Lost.” It is a mistake to suppose that
he could ever have been intended for the popular personification
of evil. Implacable hate, patient cunning,
and a sleepless refinement of device to inflict the
extremest anguish on an enemy, these things are evil;
and, although venial in a slave, are not to be forgiven
in a tyrant; although redeemed by much that ennobles
his defeat in one subdued, are marked by all that
dishonours his conquest in the victor. Milton’s Devil
as a moral being is as far superior to his God, as one
who perseveres in some purpose which he has conceived
to be excellent in spite of adversity and torture, is
to one who in the cold security of undoubted triumph
inflicts the most horrible revenge upon his enemy, not
from any mistaken notion of inducing him to repent of
a perseverance in enmity, but with the alleged design
of exasperating him to deserve new torments. Milton
has so far violated the popular creed (if this shall be
judged to be a violation) as to have alleged no superiority
of moral virtue to his god over his devil. And this
bold neglect of a direct moral purpose is the most<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
decisive proof of the supremacy of Milton’s genius.
He mingled as it were the elements of human nature
as colours upon a single palette, and arranged them
in the composition of his great picture according to
the laws of epic truth, that is, according to the laws
of that principle by which a series of actions of the
external universe and of intelligent and ethical beings
is calculated to excite the sympathy of succeeding generations
of mankind. The Divina Commedia and Paradise
Lost have conferred upon modern mythology a
systematic form; and when change and time shall have
added one more superstition to the mass of those which
have arisen and decayed upon the earth, commentators
will be learnedly employed in elucidating the religion
of ancestral Europe, only not utterly forgotten because
it will have been stamped with the eternity of genius.</p>

<p>Homer was the first and Dante the second epic poet:
that is, the second poet, the series of whose creations
bore a defined and intelligible relation to the knowledge
and sentiment and religion of the age in which he lived,
and of the ages which followed it: developing itself in
correspondence with their development. For Lucretius
had limed the wings of his swift spirit in the dregs of
the sensible world; and Virgil, with a modesty that ill
became his genius, had affected the fame of an imitator,
even whilst he created anew all that he copied; and
none among the flock of mock-birds, though their
notes are sweet, Apollonius Rhodius, Quintus Calaber,
Smyrnæus, Nonnus, Lucan, Statius, or Claudian, have
sought even to fulfil a single condition of epic truth.
Milton was the third epic poet. For if the title of
epic in its highest sense be refused to the Æneid, still
less can it be conceded to the Orlando Furioso, the
Gerusalemme Liberata, the Lusiad, or the Fairy
Queen.</p>

<p>Dante and Milton were both deeply penetrated with
the ancient religion of the civilised world; and its spirit<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
exists in their poetry probably in the same proportion as
its forms survived in the unreformed worship of modern
Europe. The one preceded and the other followed the
Reformation at almost equal intervals. Dante was the
first religious reformer, and Luther surpassed him
rather in the rudeness and acrimony, than in the boldness
of his censures, of papal usurpation. Dante was
the first awakener of entranced Europe; he created a
language, in itself music and persuasion, out of a chaos
of inharmonious barbarisms. He was the congregator
of those great spirits who presided over the resurrection
of learning; the Lucifer of that starry flock which in
the thirteenth century shone forth from republican Italy,
as from a heaven, into the darkness of the benighted
world. His very words are instinct with spirit; each is
as a spark, a burning atom of inextinguishable thought;
and many yet lie covered in the ashes of their birth, and
pregnant with a lightning which has yet found no conductor.
All high poetry is infinite; it is as the first
acorn, which contained all oaks potentially. Veil after
veil may be undrawn, and the inmost naked beauty of
the meaning never exposed. A great poem is a fountain
for ever overflowing with the waters of wisdom and
delight; and after one person and one age has exhausted
all of its divine effluence which their peculiar relations
enable them to share, another and yet another succeeds,
and new relations are ever developed, the source of an
unforeseen and an unconceived delight.</p>

<p>The age immediately succeeding to that of Dante,
Petrarch, and Boccaccio, was characterised by a revival
of painting, sculpture, and architecture. Chaucer caught
the sacred inspiration, and the superstructure of English
literature is based upon the materials of Italian invention.</p>

<p>But let us not be betrayed from a defence into a
critical history of poetry and its influence on society.
Be it enough to have pointed out the effects of poets, in<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
the large and true sense of the word, upon their own
and all succeeding times.</p>

<p>But poets have been challenged to resign the civic
crown to reasoners and mechanists, on another plea.
It is admitted that the exercise of the imagination is
most delightful, but it is alleged that that of reason is
more useful. Let us examine, as the grounds of this
distinction, what is here meant by utility. Pleasure or
good, in a general sense, is that which the consciousness
of a sensitive and intelligent being seeks, and in which,
when found, it acquiesces. There are two kinds of
pleasure, one durable, universal, and permanent; the
other transitory and particular. Utility may either
express the means of producing the former or the latter.
In the former sense, whatever strengthens and purifies
the affections, enlarges the imagination, and adds spirit
to sense, is useful. But a narrower meaning may be
assigned to the word utility, confining it to express that
which banishes the importunity of the wants of our
animal nature, the surrounding men with security of
life, the dispersing the grosser delusions of superstition,
and the conciliating such a degree of mutual forbearance
among men as may consist with the motives of personal
advantage.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the promoters of utility, in this limited
sense, have their appointed office in society. They
follow the footsteps of poets, and copy the sketches
of their creations into the book of common life. They
make space, and give time. Their exertions are of the
highest value, so long as they confine their administration
of the concerns of the inferior powers of our nature
within the limits due to the superior ones. But while
the sceptic destroys gross superstitions, let him spare to
deface, as some of the French writers have defaced,
the eternal truths charactered upon the imaginations of
men. Whilst the mechanist abridges, and the political
economist combines, labour, let them beware that their<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
speculations, for want of correspondence with those first
principles which belong to the imagination, do not tend,
as they have in modern England, to exasperate at once
the extremes of luxury and want. They have exemplified
the saying, “To him that hath, more shall be
given; and from him that hath not, the little that he
hath shall be taken away.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The rich have become
richer, and the poor have become poorer; and the
vessel of the state is driven between the Scylla and
Charybdis of anarchy and despotism. Such are the
effects which must ever flow from an unmitigated
exercise of the calculating faculty.</p>

<p>It is difficult to define pleasure in its highest sense;
the definition involving a number of apparent paradoxes.
For, from an inexplicable defect of harmony in the constitution
of human nature, the pain of the inferior is
frequently connected with the pleasures of the superior
portions of our being. Sorrow, terror, anguish, despair
itself, are often the chosen expressions of an approximation
to the highest good. Our sympathy in tragic fiction
depends on this principle; tragedy delights by affording
a shadow of that pleasure which exists in pain. This is
the source also of the melancholy which is inseparable
from the sweetest melody. The pleasure that is in
sorrow is sweeter than the pleasure of pleasure itself.
And hence the saying, “It is better to go to the house
of mourning than to the house of mirth.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Not that this
highest species of pleasure is necessarily linked with
pain. The delight of love and friendship, the ecstasy
of the admiration of nature, the joy of the perception
and still more of the creation of poetry, is often wholly
unalloyed.</p>

<p>The production and assurance of pleasure in this
highest sense is true utility. Those who produce and
preserve this pleasure are poets or poetical philosophers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>The exertions of Locke, Hume, Gibbon, Voltaire,
Rousseau,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and their disciples, in favour of oppressed
and deluded humanity, are entitled to the gratitude of
mankind. Yet it is easy to calculate the degree of moral
and intellectual improvement which the world would
have exhibited, had they never lived. A little more
nonsense would have been talked for a century or two;
and perhaps a few more men, women, and children,
burnt as heretics. We might not at this moment have
been congratulating each other on the abolition of the
Inquisition in Spain. But it exceeds all imagination to
conceive what would have been the moral condition
of the world if neither Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio,
Chaucer, Shakespeare, Calderon, Bacon, nor Milton,
had ever existed; if Raphael and Michael Angelo
had never been born; if the Hebrew poetry had
never been translated; if a revival of the study of
Greek literature had never taken place; if no monuments
of ancient sculpture had been handed down to
us; and if the poetry of the religion of the ancient
world had been extinguished together with its belief.
The human mind could never, except by the intervention
of these excitements, have been awakened to
the invention of the grosser sciences, and that application
of analytical reasoning to the aberrations of
society, which it is now attempted to exalt over the
direct expression of the inventive and creative faculty
itself.</p>

<p>We have more moral, political, and historical wisdom
than we know how to reduce into practice; we have
more scientific and economical knowledge than can be
accommodated to the just distribution of the produce
which it multiplies. The poetry, in these systems of
thought, is concealed by the accumulation of facts and<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
calculating processes. There is no want of knowledge
respecting what is wisest and best in morals, government,
and political economy, or at least what is wiser
and better than what men now practise and endure.
But we let “<i>I dare not</i> wait upon <i>I would</i>, like the poor
cat in the adage.” We want the creative faculty to
imagine that which we know; we want the generous
impulse to act that which we imagine; we want the
poetry of life: our calculations have outrun conception;
we have eaten more than we can digest. The cultivation
of those sciences which have enlarged the limits of the
empire of man over the external world, has, for want of
the poetical faculty, proportionally circumscribed those
of the internal world; and man, having enslaved the
elements, remains himself a slave. To what but a
cultivation of the mechanical arts in a degree disproportioned
to the presence of the creative faculty, which
is the basis of all knowledge, is to be attributed the
abuse of all invention for abridging and combining
labour, to the exasperation of the inequality of mankind?
From what other cause has it arisen that the discoveries
which should have lightened, have added a weight to
the curse imposed on Adam? Poetry, and the principle
of Self, of which money is the visible incarnation, are
the God and Mammon of the world.</p>

<p>The functions of the poetical faculty are twofold; by
one it creates new materials of knowledge, and power,
and pleasure; by the other it engenders in the mind a
desire to reproduce and arrange them according to a
certain rhythm and order, which may be called the
beautiful and the good. The cultivation of poetry is
never more to be desired than at periods when, from
an excess of the selfish and calculating principle, the
accumulation of the materials of external life exceed the
quantity of the power of assimilating them to the internal
laws of human nature. The body has then become too
unwieldy for that which animates it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>Poetry is indeed something divine. It is at once the
centre and circumference of knowledge; it is that which
comprehends all science, and that to which all science
must be referred. It is at the same time the root and
blossom of all other systems of thought; it is that from
which all spring, and that which adorns all; and that
which, if blighted, denies the fruit and the seed, and
withholds from the barren world the nourishment and
the succession of the scions of the tree of life. It is the
perfect and consummate surface and bloom of all things;
it is as the odour and the colour of the rose to the
texture of the elements which compose it, as the form and
splendour of unfaded beauty to the secrets of anatomy
and corruption. What were virtue, love, patriotism,
friendship,&mdash;what were the scenery of this beautiful
universe which we inhabit; what were our consolations
on this side of the grave&mdash;and what were our aspirations
beyond it, if poetry did not ascend to bring light and
fire from those eternal regions where the owl-winged
faculty of calculation dare not ever soar? Poetry is
not like reasoning, a power to be exerted according to
the determination of the will. A man cannot say, “I
will compose poetry.” The greatest poet even cannot
say it; for the mind in creation is as a fading coal,
which some invisible influence, like an inconstant wind,
awakens to transitory brightness; this power arises
from within, like the colour of a flower which fades and
changes as it is developed, and the conscious portions
of our nature are unprophetic either of its approach or
its departure. Could this influence be durable in its
original purity and force, it is impossible to predict the
greatness of the results; but when composition begins,
inspiration is already on the decline, and the most
glorious poetry that has ever been communicated to the
world is probably a feeble shadow of the original conceptions
of the poet. I appeal to the greatest poets of
the present day, whether it is not an error to assert that
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
the finest passages of poetry are produced by labour and
study. The toil and the delay recommended by critics
can be justly interpreted to mean no more than a
careful observation of the inspired moments, and an
artificial connexion of the spaces between their suggestions,
by the intertexture of conventional expressions; a
necessity only imposed by the limitedness of the poetical
faculty itself: for Milton conceived the Paradise Lost
as a whole before he executed it in portions. We have
his own authority also for the muse having “dictated”
to him the “unpremeditated song.” And let this be an
answer to those who would allege the fifty-six various
readings of the first line of the Orlando Furioso. Compositions
so produced are to poetry what mosaic is to
painting. The instinct and intuition of the poetical
faculty is still more observable in the plastic and
pictorial arts: a great statue or picture grows under the
power of the artist as a child in the mother’s womb;
and the very mind which directs the hands in formation,
is incapable of accounting to itself for the origin, the
gradations, or the media of the process.</p>

<p>Poetry is the record of the best and happiest moments
of the happiest and best minds. We are aware of
evanescent visitations of thought and feeling, sometimes
associated with place or person, sometimes regarding
our own mind alone, and always arising unforeseen and
departing unbidden, but elevating and delightful beyond
all expression: so that even in the desire and the regret
they leave, there cannot but be pleasure, participating
as it does in the nature of its object. It is as it were
the interpenetration of a diviner nature through our
own; but its footsteps are like those of a wind over the
sea, which the morning calm erases, and whose traces
remain only, as on the wrinkled sand which paves it.
These and corresponding conditions of being are experienced
principally by those of the most delicate
sensibility and the most enlarged imagination; and the<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
state of mind produced by them is at war with every
base desire. The enthusiasm of virtue, love, patriotism,
and friendship, is essentially linked with such emotions;
and whilst they last, self appears as what it is, an atom
to a universe. Poets are not only subject to these
experiences as spirits of the most refined organisation,
but they can colour all that they combine with the
evanescent hues of this ethereal world; a word, a trait
in the representation of a scene or a passion, will touch
the enchanted chord, and reanimate, in those who have
ever experienced those emotions, the sleeping, the cold,
the buried image of the past. Poetry thus makes
immortal all that is best and most beautiful in the
world; it arrests the vanishing apparitions which haunt
the interlunations of life, and veiling them, or in language
or in form, sends them forth among mankind,
bearing sweet news of kindred joy to those with
whom their sisters abide&mdash;abide, because there is no
portal of expression from the caverns of the spirit
which they inhabit into the universe of things. Poetry
redeems from decay the visitations of the divinity in
man.</p>

<p>Poetry turns all things to loveliness; it exalts the
beauty of that which is most beautiful, and it adds
beauty to that which is most deformed; it marries
exultation and horror, grief and pleasure, eternity and
change; it subdues to union, under its light yoke, all
irreconcilable things. It transmutes all that it touches,
and every form moving within the radiance of its
presence is changed by wondrous sympathy to an incarnation
of the spirit which it breathes: its secret alchemy
turns to potable gold the poisonous waters which flow
from death through life; it strips the veil of familiarity
from the world, and lays bare the naked and sleeping
beauty, which is the spirit of its forms.</p>

<p>All things exist as they are perceived; at least in
relation to the percipient.</p>

<p>But poetry defeats the curse which binds us to be
subjected to the accident of surrounding impressions.
And whether it spreads its own figured curtain, or withdraws
life’s dark veil from before the scene of things,
it equally creates for us a being within our being. It
makes us the inhabitant of a world to which the familiar
world is a chaos. It reproduces the common universe
of which we are portions and percipients, and it purges
from our inward sight the film of familiarity which
obscures from us the wonder of our being. It compels
us to feel that which we perceive, and to imagine that
which we know. It creates anew the universe, after it
has been annihilated in our minds by the recurrence of
impressions blunted by reiteration. It justifies the bold
and true word of Tasso: <i>Non merita nome di creatore,
se non Iddio ed il Poeta.</i></p>

<p>A poet, as he is the author to others of the highest
wisdom, pleasure, virtue and glory, so he ought personally
to be the happiest, the best, the wisest, and the most
illustrious of men. As to his glory, let time be challenged
to declare whether the fame of any other institutor of
human life be comparable to that of a poet. That he
is the wisest, the happiest, and the best, inasmuch as
he is a poet, is equally incontrovertible: the greatest
poets have been men of the most spotless virtue, of the
most consummate prudence, and, if we would look into
the interior of their lives, the most fortunate of men:
and the exceptions, as they regard those who possessed
the poetic faculty in a high yet inferior degree, will be
found on consideration to confirm rather than destroy
the rule. Let us for a moment stoop to the arbitration
of popular breath, and usurping and uniting in our own
persons the incompatible characters of accuser, witness,<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
judge and executioner, let us decide without trial,
testimony, or form, that certain motives of those who
are “there sitting where we dare not soar,” are reprehensible.
Let us assume that Homer was a drunkard,
that Virgil was a flatterer, that Horace was a coward,
that Tasso was a madman, that Bacon was a speculator,
that Raphael was a libertine, that Spenser was
a poet laureate. It is inconsistent with this division
of our subject to cite living poets, but posterity has
done ample justice to the great names now referred
to. Their errors have been weighed and found to have
been dust in the balance; if their sins “were as scarlet,
they are now white as snow:” they have been washed
in the blood of the mediator and redeemer, time.
Observe in what a ludicrous chaos the imputations of
real or fictitious crime have been confused in the contemporary
calumnies against poetry and poets; consider
how little is, as it appears&mdash;or appears, as it is, look
to your own motives, and judge not, lest ye be judged.</p>

<p>Poetry, as has been said, differs in this respect from
logic, that it is not subject to the control of the active
powers of the mind, and that its birth and recurrence
have no necessary connexion with the consciousness or
will. It is presumptuous to determine that these are
the necessary conditions of all mental causation, when
mental effects are experienced insusceptible of being
referred to them. The frequent recurrence of the
poetical power, it is obvious to suppose, may produce
in the mind a habit of order and harmony correlative
with its own nature and with its effects upon other minds.
But in the intervals of inspiration, and they may be frequent
without being durable, a poet becomes a man, and
is abandoned to the sudden reflux of the influences under
which others habitually live. But as he is more
delicately organised than other men, and sensible to
pain and pleasure, both his own and that of others, in a
degree unknown to them, he will avoid the one and<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
pursue the other with an ardour proportioned to this
difference. And he renders himself obnoxious to calumny,
when he neglects to observe the circumstances under
which these objects of universal pursuit and flight have
disguised themselves in one another’s garments.</p>

<p>But there is nothing necessarily evil in this error, and
thus cruelty, envy, revenge, avarice, and the passions
purely evil, have never formed any portion of the popular
imputations on the lives of poets.</p>

<p>I have thought it most favourable to the cause of
truth to set down these remarks according to the order
in which they were suggested to my mind, by a consideration
of the subject itself, instead of observing the
formality of a polemical reply; but if the view which
they contain be just, they will be found to involve a
refutation of the arguers against poetry, so far at least
as regards the first division of the subject. I can
readily conjecture what should have moved the gall of
some learned and intelligent writers who quarrel with
certain versifiers; I, like them, confess myself unwilling
to be stunned by the Theseids of the hoarse Codri of
the day. Bavius and Mævius undoubtedly are, as they
ever were, insufferable persons. But it belongs to a
philosophical critic to distinguish rather than confound.</p>

<p>The first part of these remarks has related to poetry
in its elements and principles: and it has been shown,
as well as the narrow limits assigned them would
permit, that what is called poetry in a restricted sense,
has a common source with all other forms of order and
of beauty, according to which the materials of human
life are susceptible of being arranged, and which is
poetry in an universal sense.</p>

<p>The second part will have for its object an application
of these principles to the present state of the cultivation
of poetry, and a defence of the attempt to idealise
the modern forms of manners and opinions, and compel
them into a subordination to the imaginative and creative<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
faculty. For the literature of England, an energetic
development of which has ever preceded or accompanied
a great and free development of the national will, has
arisen as it were from a new birth. In spite of the
low-thoughted envy which would undervalue contemporary
merit, our own will be a memorable age in
intellectual achievements, and we live among such
philosophers and poets as surpass beyond comparison
any who have appeared since the last national struggle
for civil and religious liberty. The most unfailing
herald, companion, and follower of the awakening of a
great people to work a beneficial change in opinion
or institution, is poetry. At such periods there is an
accumulation of the power of communicating and
receiving intense and impassioned conceptions respecting
man and nature. The persons in whom this power
resides may often, as far as regards many portions of
their nature, have little apparent correspondence with
that spirit of good of which they are the ministers.
But even whilst they deny and abjure, they are yet
compelled to serve, the power which is seated on the
throne of their own soul. It is impossible to read the
compositions of the most celebrated writers of the
present day without being startled with the electric life
which burns within their words. They measure the
circumference and sound the depths of human nature
with a comprehensive and all-penetrating spirit, and they
are themselves perhaps the most sincerely astonished at
its manifestations; for it is less their spirit than the
spirit of the age. Poets are the hierophants of an unapprehended
inspiration; the mirrors of the gigantic
shadows which futurity casts upon the present; the
words which express what they understand not; the
trumpets which sing to battle and feel not what they
inspire; the influence which is moved not, but moves.
Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world.</p>

<small>ON THE LITERATURE, THE ARTS, AND
THE MANNERS OF THE ATHENIANS.</small></h2>

<p class="h2sub fantasy">A Fragment.</p>

<p class="dropcap-first-letter">The period which intervened between the birth
of Pericles and the death of Aristotle, is undoubtedly,
whether considered in itself, or with
reference to the effects which it has produced upon
the subsequent destinies of civilised man, the most
memorable in the history of the world. What was the
combination of moral and political circumstances which
produced so unparalleled a progress during that period
in literature and the arts;&mdash;why that progress, so rapid
and so sustained, so soon received a check, and became
retrograde,&mdash;are problems left to the wonder and conjecture
of posterity. The wrecks and fragments of those
subtle and profound minds, like the ruins of a fine statue,
obscurely suggest to us the grandeur and perfection of
the whole. Their very language&mdash;a type of the understandings
of which it was the creation and the image&mdash;in
variety, in simplicity, in flexibility, and in copiousness,
excels every other language of the western world. Their
sculptures are such as we, in our presumption, assume to
be the models of ideal truth and beauty, and to which<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
no artist of modern times can produce forms in any
degree comparable. Their paintings, according to Pliny
and Pausanias, were full of delicacy and harmony; and
some even were powerfully pathetic, so as to awaken,
like tender music or tragic poetry, the most overwhelming
emotions. We are accustomed to conceive the painters
of the sixteenth century, as those who have brought
their art to the highest perfection, probably because
none of the ancient paintings have been preserved.
For all the inventive arts maintain, as it were, a
sympathetic connexion between each other, being no
more than various expressions of one internal power,
modified by different circumstances, either of an individual,
or of society; and the paintings of that period
would probably bear the same relation as is confessedly
borne by the sculptures to all succeeding ones. Of their
music we know little; but the effects which it is said to
have produced, whether they be attributed to the skill
of the composer, or the sensibility of his audience, are
far more powerful than any which we experience from
the music of our own times; and if, indeed, the melody
of their compositions were more tender and delicate,
and inspiring, than the melodies of some modern
European nations, their superiority in this art must
have been something wonderful, and wholly beyond
conception.</p>

<p>Their poetry seems to maintain a very high, though
not so disproportionate a rank, in the comparison.
Perhaps Shakespeare, from the variety and comprehension
of his genius, is to be considered, on the
whole, as the greatest individual mind, of which we
have specimens remaining. Perhaps Dante created
imaginations of greater loveliness and energy than
any that are to be found in the ancient literature of
Greece. Perhaps nothing has been discovered in the
fragments of the Greek lyric poets equivalent to the
sublime and chivalric sensibility of Petrarch.&mdash;But, as<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
a poet, Homer must be acknowledged to excel Shakespeare
in the truth, the harmony, the sustained
grandeur, the satisfying completeness of his images,
their exact fitness to the illustration, and to that to
which they belong. Nor could Dante, deficient in
conduct, plan, nature, variety, and temperance, have
been brought into comparison with these men, but for
those fortunate isles, laden with golden fruit, which
alone could tempt any one to embark in the misty
ocean of his dark and extravagant fiction.</p>

<p>But, omitting the comparison of individual minds,
which can afford no general inference, how superior was
the spirit and system of their poetry to that of any other
period! So that, had any other genius equal in other
respects to the greatest that ever enlightened the world,
arisen in that age, he would have been superior to all,
from this circumstance alone&mdash;that his conceptions
would have assumed a more harmonious and perfect
form. For it is worthy of observation, that whatever
the poets of that age produced is as harmonious and
perfect as possible. If a drama, for instance, were the
composition of a person of inferior talent, it was still
homogeneous and free from inequalities; it was a whole,
consistent with itself. The compositions of great minds
bore throughout the sustained stamp of their greatness.
In the poetry of succeeding ages the expectations are
often exalted on Icarian wings, and fall, too much disappointed
to give a memory and a name to the oblivious
pool in which they fell.</p>

<p>In physical knowledge Aristotle and Theophrastus
had already&mdash;no doubt assisted by the labours of those
of their predecessors whom they criticise&mdash;made advances
worthy of the maturity of science. The astonishing
invention of geometry, that series of discoveries which
have enabled man to command the elements and foresee
future events, before the subjects of his ignorant wonder,
and which have opened as it were the doors of the
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
mysteries of nature, had already been brought to great
perfection. Metaphysics, the science of man’s intimate
nature, and logic, or the grammar and elementary
principles of that science, received from the latter
philosophers of the Periclean age a firm basis. All our
more exact philosophy is built upon the labours of these
great men, and many of the words which we employ in
metaphysical distinctions were invented by them to give
accuracy and system to their reasonings. The science
of morals, or the voluntary conduct of men in relation
to themselves or others, dates from this epoch. How
inexpressibly bolder and more pure were the doctrines
of those great men, in comparison with the timid maxims
which prevail in the writings of the most esteemed
modern moralists! They were such as Phocion, and
Epaminondas, and Timoleon, who formed themselves
on their influence, were to the wretched heroes of our
own age.</p>

<p>Their political and religious institutions are more
difficult to bring into comparison with those of other
times. A summary idea may be formed of the worth
of any political and religious system, by observing the
comparative degree of happiness and of intellect produced
under its influence. And whilst many institutions
and opinions, which in ancient Greece were obstacles to
the improvement of the human race, have been abolished
among modern nations, how many pernicious superstitions
and new contrivances of misrule, and unheard-of
complications of public mischief, have not been invented
among them by the ever-watchful spirit of avarice and
tyranny!</p>

<p>The modern nations of the civilised world owe the
progress which they have made&mdash;as well in those
physical sciences in which they have already excelled
their masters, as in the moral and intellectual inquiries,
in which, with all the advantage of the experience of
the latter, it can scarcely be said that they have yet
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
equalled them,&mdash;to what is called the revival of learning;
that is, the study of the writers of the age which
preceded and immediately followed the government of
Pericles, or of subsequent writers, who were, so to speak,
the rivers flowing from those immortal fountains. And
though there seems to be a principle in the modern
world, which, should circumstances analogous to those
which modelled the intellectual resources of the age to
which we refer, into so harmonious a proportion, again
arise, would arrest and perpetuate them, and consign
their results to a more equal, extensive, and lasting
improvement of the condition of man&mdash;though justice
and the true meaning of human society are, if not more
accurately, more generally understood; though perhaps
men know more, and therefore are more, as a mass, yet
this principle has never been called into action, and
requires indeed a universal and an almost appalling
change in the system of existing things. The study of
modern history is the study of kings, financiers, statesmen,
and priests. The history of ancient Greece is the
study of legislators, philosophers, and poets; it is the
history of men, compared with the history of titles.
What the Greeks were, was a reality, not a promise.
And what we are and hope to be, is derived, as it were,
from the influence and inspiration of these glorious
generations.</p>

<p>Whatever tends to afford a further illustration of the
manners and opinions of those to whom we owe so
much, and who were perhaps, on the whole, the most
perfect specimens of humanity of whom we have
authentic record, were infinitely valuable. Let us see
their errors, their weaknesses, their daily actions, their
familiar conversation, and catch the tone of their society.
When we discover how far the most admirable community
ever framed was removed from that perfection
to which human society is impelled by some active
power within each bosom to aspire, how great ought to<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
be our hopes, how resolute our struggles! For the
Greeks of the Periclean age were widely different from
us. It is to be lamented that no modern writer has
hitherto dared to show them precisely as they were.
Barthélemi cannot be denied the praise of industry and
system; but he never forgets that he is a Christian and
a Frenchman. Wieland, in his delightful novels, makes
indeed a very tolerable Pagan, but cherishes too many
political prejudices, and refrains from diminishing the
interest of his romances by painting sentiments in which
no European of modern times can possibly sympathise.
There is no book which shows the Greeks precisely as
they were; they seem all written for children, with the
caution that no practice or sentiment, highly inconsistent
with our present manners, should be mentioned,
lest those manners should receive outrage and violation.
But there are many to whom the Greek language is
inaccessible, who ought not to be excluded by this
prudery from possessing an exact and comprehensive
conception of the history of man; for there is no knowledge
concerning what man has been and may be, from
partaking of which a person can depart, without becoming
in some degree more philosophical, tolerant,
and just.</p>

<p>One of the chief distinctions between the manners
of ancient Greece and modern Europe, consisted in
the regulations and the sentiments respecting sexual
intercourse. Whether this difference arises from some
imperfect influence of the doctrines of Jesus, who
alleges the absolute and unconditional equality of all
human beings, or from the institutions of chivalry, or
from a certain fundamental difference of physical nature
existing in the Celts, or from a combination of all or
any of these causes acting on each other, is a question
worthy of voluminous investigation. The fact is, that
the modern Europeans have in this circumstance, and
in the abolition of slavery, made an improvement the<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
most decisive in the regulation of human society; and
all the virtue and the wisdom of the Periclean age arose
under other institutions, in spite of the diminution
which personal slavery and the inferiority of women,
recognised by law and opinion, must have produced in
the delicacy, the strength, the comprehensiveness, and
the accuracy of their conceptions, in moral, political,
and metaphysical science, and perhaps in every other
art and science.</p>

<p>The women, thus degraded, became such as it was
expected they would become. They possessed, except
with extraordinary exceptions, the habits and the
qualities of slaves. They were probably not extremely
beautiful; at least there was no such disproportion in
the attractions of the external form between the female
and male sex among the Greeks, as exists among the
modern Europeans. They were certainly devoid of
that moral and intellectual loveliness with which the
acquisition of knowledge and the cultivation of sentiment
animates, as with another life of overpowering
grace, the lineaments and the gestures of every form
which they inhabit. Their eyes could not have been
deep and intricate from the workings of the mind,
and could have entangled no heart in soul-enwoven
labyrinths.</p>

<p>Let it not be imagined that because the Greeks were
deprived of its legitimate object, they were incapable of
sentimental love; and that this passion is the mere
child of chivalry and the literature of modern times.
This object or its archetype forever exists in the mind,
which selects among those who resemble it that which
most resembles it; and instinctively fills up the interstices
of the imperfect image, in the same manner as
the imagination moulds and completes the shapes in
clouds, or in the fire, into the resemblances of whatever
form, animal, building, &amp;c., happens to be present to it.
Man is in his wildest state a social being: a certain
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
degree of civilisation and refinement ever produces
the want of sympathies still more intimate and complete;
and the gratification of the senses is no longer
all that is sought in sexual connexion. It soon becomes
a very small part of that profound and complicated
sentiment, which we call love, which is rather the
universal thirst for a communion not only of the
senses, but of our whole nature, intellectual, imaginative
and sensitive, and which, when individualised,
becomes an imperious necessity, only to be satisfied
by the complete or partial, actual or supposed fulfilment
of its claims. This want grows more powerful
in proportion to the development which our nature
receives from civilisation, for man never ceases to
be a social being. The sexual impulse, which is only
one, and often a small part of those claims, serves,
from its obvious and external nature, as a kind of type
or expression of the rest, a common basis, an acknowledged
and visible link. Still it is a claim which even
derives a strength not its own from the accessory circumstances
which surround it, and one which our nature
thirsts to satisfy. To estimate this, observe the degree
of intensity and durability of the love of the male towards
the female in animals and savages; and acknowledge
all the duration and intensity observable in the
love of civilised beings beyond that of savages to be
produced from other causes. In the susceptibility of
the external senses there is probably no important
difference.</p>

<p>Among the ancient Greeks the male sex, one half
of the human race, received the highest cultivation and
refinement: whilst the other, so far as intellect is concerned,
were educated as slaves, and were raised but
few degrees in all that related to moral or intellectual
excellence above the condition of savages. The gradations
in the society of man present us with slow improvement
in this respect. The Roman women held a higher<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
consideration in society, and were esteemed almost as
the equal partners with their husbands in the regulation
of domestic economy and the education of their children.
The practices and customs of modern Europe are essentially
different from and incomparably less pernicious
than either, however remote from what an enlightened
mind cannot fail to desire as the future destiny of
human beings.</p>

<small>OR PREFACE TO THE BANQUET OF PLATO.</small></h2>

<h3 class="fantasy">A Fragment.</h3>
</div>

<p class="dropcap-first-letter">The dialogue entitled “The Banquet,” was selected
by the translator as the most beautiful and
perfect among all the works of Plato.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> He
despairs of having communicated to the English language
any portion of the surpassing graces of the
composition, or having done more than present an
imperfect shadow of the language and the sentiment
of this astonishing production.</p>

<p>Plato is eminently the greatest among the Greek
philosophers, and from, or, rather, perhaps through
him, from his master Socrates, have proceeded those
emanations of moral and metaphysical knowledge, on
which a long series and an incalculable variety of
popular superstitions have sheltered their absurdities
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
from the slow contempt of mankind. Plato exhibits
the rare union of close and subtle logic with the
Pythian enthusiasm of poetry, melted by the splendour
and harmony of his periods into one irresistible stream
of musical impressions, which hurry the persuasions
onward, as in a breathless career. His language
is that of an immortal spirit, rather than a man.
Bacon is, perhaps, the only writer who, in these particulars,
can be compared with him: his imitator,
Cicero, sinks in the comparison into an ape mocking
the gestures of a man. His views into the nature of
mind and existence are often obscure, only because
they are profound; and though his theories respecting
the government of the world, and the elementary laws
of moral action, are not always correct, yet there is
scarcely any of his treatises which do not, however
stained by puerile sophisms, contain the most remarkable
intuitions into all that can be the subject of the
human mind. His excellence consists especially in
intuition, and it is this faculty which raises him far
above Aristotle, whose genius, though vivid and various,
is obscure in comparison with that of Plato.</p>

<p>The dialogue entitled the “Banquet,” is called
Ερωτικος, or a Discussion upon Love, and is supposed
to have taken place at the house of Agathon, at one of
a series of festivals given by that poet, on the occasion
of his gaining the prize of tragedy at the Dionysiaca.
The account of the debate on this occasion is supposed
to have been given by Apollodorus, a pupil of Socrates,
many years after it had taken place, to a companion
who was curious to hear it. This Apollodorus appears,
both from the style in which he is represented in this
piece, as well as from a passage in the Phædon, to have
been a person of an impassioned and enthusiastic disposition;
to borrow an image from the Italian painters,
he seems to have been the St. John of the Socratic
group. The drama (for so the lively distinction of
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
character and the various and well-wrought circumstances
of the story almost entitle it to be called)
begins by Socrates persuading Aristodemus to sup at
Agathon’s, uninvited. The whole of this introduction
affords the most lively conception of refined Athenian
manners.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> The Republic, though replete with considerable errors of speculation,
is, indeed, the greatest repository of important truths of all
the works of Plato. This, perhaps, is because it is the longest.
He first, and perhaps last, maintained that a state ought to be
governed, not by the wealthiest, or the most ambitious, or the
most cunning, but by the wisest; the method of selecting such
rulers, and the laws by which such a selection is made, must correspond
with and arise out of the moral freedom and refinement of
the people.</p>

<h3>APOLLODORUS.</h3>

<p class="dropcap-first-letter">I think that the subject of your inquiries is still
fresh in my memory; for yesterday, as I chanced
to be returning home from Phaleros, one of my
acquaintance, seeing me before him, called out to me
from a distance, jokingly, “Apollodorus, you Phalerian,
will you not wait a minute?”&mdash;I waited for him, and as
soon as he overtook me, “I have just been looking for
you, Apollodorus,” he said, “for I wished to hear what
those discussions were on Love, which took place at the
party, when Agathon, Socrates, Alcibiades, and some
others, met at supper. Some one who heard it from
Phœnix, the son of Philip, told me that you could give
a full account, but he could relate nothing distinctly
himself. Relate to me, then, I entreat you, all the
circumstances. I know you are a faithful reporter
of the discussions of your friends; but, first tell me,
were you present at the party or not?”</p>

<p>“Your informant,” I replied, “seems to have given
you no very clear idea of what you wish to hear, if he
thinks that these discussions took place so lately as that
I could have been of the party.”&mdash;“Indeed, I thought
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
so,” replied he.&mdash;“For how,” said I, “O Glauco! could
I have been present? Do you not know that Agathon
has been absent from the city many years? But, since
I began to converse with Socrates, and to observe each
day all his words and actions, three years are scarcely
past. Before this time I wandered about wherever it
might chance, thinking that I did something, but being
in truth, a most miserable wretch, not less than you are
now, who believe that you ought to do anything rather
than practise the love of wisdom.”&mdash;“Do not cavil,”
interrupted Glauco, “but tell me, when did this party
take place?”</p>

<p>“Whilst we were yet children,” I replied, “when
Agathon first gained the prize of tragedy, and the day
after that on which he and the chorus made sacrifices in
celebration of their success.”&mdash;“A long time ago, it
seems. But who told you all the circumstances of the
discussion? Did you hear them from Socrates himself?”
“No, by Jupiter! But the same person from whom
Phœnix had his information, one Aristodemus, a Cydathenean,&mdash;a
little man who always went about without
sandals. He was present at this feast, being, I believe,
more than any of his contemporaries, a lover and
admirer of Socrates. I have questioned Socrates concerning
some of the circumstances of his narration, who
confirms all that I have heard from Aristodemus.”&mdash;“Why,
then,” said Glauco, “why not relate them, as we
walk, to me? The road to the city is every way convenient,
both for those who listen and those who speak.”</p>

<p>Thus as we walked I gave him some account of those
discussions concerning Love; since, as I said before,
I remember them with sufficient accuracy. If I am
required to relate them also to you, that shall willingly
be done; for, whensoever either I myself talk of philosophy,
or listen to others talking of it, in addition to
the improvement which I conceive there arises from
such conversation, I am delighted beyond measure;<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
but whenever I hear your discussions about moneyed
men and great proprietors, I am weighed down with
grief, and pity you, who, doing nothing, believe that you
are doing something. Perhaps you think that I am a
miserable wretch; and, indeed, I believe that you
think truly. I do not think, but well know, that you
are miserable.</p>

<h3>COMPANION.</h3>

<p>You are always the same, Apollodorus&mdash;always
saying some ill of yourself and others. Indeed, you
seem to me to think every one miserable except Socrates,
beginning with yourself. I do not know what could
have entitled you to the surname of the “Madman,”
for, I am sure, you are consistent enough, for ever
inveighing with bitterness against yourself and all others,
except Socrates.</p>

<h3>APOLLODORUS.</h3>

<p>My dear friend, it is manifest that I am out of my
wits from this alone&mdash;that I have such opinion as you
describe concerning myself and you.</p>

<h3>COMPANION.</h3>

<p>It is not worth while, Apollodorus, to dispute now
about these things; but do what I entreat you, and
relate to us what were these discussions.</p>

<h3>APOLLODORUS.</h3>

<p>They were such as I will proceed to tell you. But
let me attempt to relate them in the order which Aristodemus
observed in relating them to me. He said that
he met Socrates washed, and, contrary to his usual
custom, sandalled, and having inquired whither he went
so gaily dressed, Socrates replied, “I am going to sup
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
at Agathon’s; yesterday I avoided it, disliking the
crowd, which would attend at the prize sacrifices then
celebrated; to-day I promised to be there, and I made
myself so gay, because one ought to be beautiful to
approach one who is beautiful. But you, Aristodemus,
what think you of coming uninvited to supper?”&mdash;“I
will do,” he replied, “as you command.”&mdash;“Follow,
then, that we may, by changing its application, disarm
that proverb which says, <i>To the feasts of the good, the
good come uninvited.</i> Homer, indeed, seems not only
to destroy, but to outrage the proverb; for, describing
Agamemnon as excellent in battle, and Menelaus but
a faint-hearted warrior, he represents Menelaus as
coming uninvited to the feast of one better and braver
than himself.”&mdash;Aristodemus hearing this, said, “I also
am in some danger, Socrates, not as you say, but
according to Homer, of approaching like an unworthy
inferior, the banquet of one more wise and excellent
than myself. Will you not, then, make some excuse
for me? for I shall not confess that I came uninvited,
but shall say that I was invited by you.”&mdash;“As we walk
together,” said Socrates, “we will consider together
what excuse to make&mdash;but let us go.”</p>

<p>Thus discoursing, they proceeded. But, as they
walked, Socrates, engaged in some deep contemplation,
slackened his pace, and, observing Aristodemus waiting
for him, he desired him to go on before. When Aristodemus
arrived at Agathon’s house he found the
door open, and it occurred somewhat comically, that
a slave met him at the vestibule, and conducted him
where he found the guests already reclined. As soon
as Agathon saw him, “You arrive just in time to sup
with us, Aristodemus,” he said; “if you have any other
purpose in your visit, defer it to a better opportunity.
I was looking for you yesterday, to invite you to be of
our party; I could not find you anywhere. But how is
it that you do not bring Socrates with you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>But he turning round, and not seeing Socrates behind
him, said to Agathon, “I just came hither in his
company, being invited by him to sup with you.”&mdash;“You
did well,” replied Agathon, “to come; but where
is Socrates?”&mdash;“He just now came hither behind me;
I myself wonder where he can be.”&mdash;“Go and look,
boy,” said Agathon, “and bring Socrates in; meanwhile,
you, Aristodemus, recline there near Eryximachus.”
And he bade a slave wash his feet that he might recline.
Another slave, meanwhile, brought word that Socrates
had retired into a neighbouring vestibule, where he
stood, and, in spite of his message, refused to come
in.&mdash;“What absurdity you talk,” cried Agathon, “call
him, and do not leave him till he comes.”&mdash;“Leave
him alone, by all means,” said Aristodemus, “it is
customary with him sometimes to retire in this way and
stand wherever it may chance. He will come presently,
I do not doubt; do not disturb him.”&mdash;“Well, be it as
you will,” said Agathon; “as it is, you boys, bring
supper for the rest; put before us what you will, for I
resolved that there should be no master of the feast.
Consider me, and these, my friends, as guests, whom
you have invited to supper, and serve them so that we
may commend you.”</p>

<p>After this they began supper, but Socrates did not
come in. Agathon ordered him to be called, but
Aristodemus perpetually forbade it. At last he came
in, much about the middle of supper, not having delayed
so long as was his custom. Agathon (who happened to
be reclining at the end of the table, and alone,) said, as
he entered, “Come hither, Socrates, and sit down by
me; so that by the mere touch of one so wise as you
are, I may enjoy the fruit of your meditations in the
vestibule; for, I well know, you would not have departed
till you had discovered and secured it.”</p>

<p>Socrates having sat down as he was desired, replied,
“It would be well, Agathon, if wisdom were of such a
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
nature, as that when we touched each other, it would
overflow of its own accord, from him who possesses
much to him who possesses little; like the water in two
chalices, which will flow through a flock of wool from
the fuller into the emptier, until both are equal. If
wisdom had this property, I should esteem myself most
fortunate in reclining near to you. I should thus soon
be filled, I think, with the most beautiful and various
wisdom. Mine, indeed, is something obscure, and
doubtful, and dreamlike. But yours is radiant, and has
been crowned with amplest reward; for, though you are
yet so young, it shone forth from you, and became so
manifest yesterday, that more than thirty thousand
Greeks can bear testimony to its excellence and loveliness.”&mdash;“You
are laughing at me, Socrates,” said
Agathon, “but you and I will decide this controversy
about wisdom by and bye, taking Bacchus for our
judge. At present turn to your supper.”</p>

<p>After Socrates and the rest had finished supper, and
had reclined back on their couches, and the libations
had been poured forth, and they had sung hymns to the
god, and all other rites which are customary had been
performed, they turned to drinking. Then Pausanias
made this kind of proposal. “Come, my friends,” said
he, “in what manner will it be pleasantest for us to
drink? I must confess to you that, in reality, I am not
very well from the wine we drank last night, and I have
need of some intermission. I suspect that most of you
are in the same condition, for you were here yesterday.
Now, consider how we shall drink most easily and
comfortably.”</p>

<p>“’Tis a good proposal, Pausanias,” said Aristophanes,
“to contrive, in some way or other, to place moderation
in our cups. I was one of those who were drenched
last night.”&mdash;Eryximachus, the son of Acumenius,
hearing this, said: “I am of your opinion; I only wish
to know one thing&mdash;whether Agathon is in the humour
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
for hard drinking?”&mdash;“Not at all,” replied Agathon,
“I confess that I am not able to drink much this
evening.”&mdash;“It is an excellent thing for us,” replied
Eryximachus, “I mean myself, Aristodemus, Phædrus,
and these others, if you who are such invincible drinkers,
now refuse to drink. I ought to except Socrates, for he
is capable of drinking everything, or nothing; and whatever
we shall determine will equally suit him. Since,
then, no one present has any desire to drink much wine,
I shall perhaps give less offence if I declare the nature
of drunkenness. The science of medicine teaches us that
drunkenness is very pernicious: nor would I choose to
drink immoderately myself, or counsel another to do so,
especially if he had been drunk the night before.”&mdash;“Yes,”
said Phædrus, the Myrinusian, interrupting him,
“I have been accustomed to confide in you, especially
in your directions concerning medicine; and I would
now willingly do so, if the rest will do the same.” All
then agreed that they would drink at this present
banquet not for drunkenness, but for pleasure.</p>

<p>“Since, then,” said Eryximachus, “it is decided that
no one shall be compelled to drink more than he pleases,
I think that we may as well send away the flute-player
to play to herself; or, if she likes, to the women within.
Let us devote the present occasion to conversation
between ourselves, and if you wish, I will propose to
you what shall be the subject of our discussion.” All
present desired and entreated that he would explain.&mdash;“The
exordium of my speech,” said Eryximachus, “will
be in the style of the Menalippe of Euripides, for the
story which I am about to tell belongs not to me, but to
Phædrus. Phædrus has often indignantly complained
to me, saying&mdash;‘Is it not strange, Eryximachus, that
there are innumerable hymns and pæans composed for
the other gods, but that not one of the many poets who
spring up in the world have ever composed a verse in
honour of Love, who is such and so great a god? Nor<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
any one of those accomplished sophists, who, like the
famous Prodicus, have celebrated the praise of Hercules
and others, have ever celebrated that of Love; but what
is more astonishing, I have lately met with the book of
some philosopher, in which salt is extolled on account
of its utility, and many other things of the same nature
are in like manner celebrated with elaborate praise.
That so much serious thought is expended on such
trifles, and that no man has dared to this day to frame
a hymn in honour of Love, who being so great a deity,
is thus neglected, may well be sufficient to excite my
indignation.’</p>

<p>“There seemed to me some justice in these complaints
of Phædrus; I propose, therefore, at the same
time for the sake of giving pleasure to Phædrus, and
that we may on the present occasion do something well
and befitting us, that this God should receive from those
who are now present the honour which is most due to
him. If you agree to my proposal, an excellent discussion
might arise on the subject. Every one ought,
according to my plan, to praise Love with as much
eloquence as he can. Let Phædrus begin first, both
because he reclines the first in order, and because he is
the father of the discussion.”</p>

<p>“No one will vote against you, Eryximachus,” said
Socrates, “for how can I oppose your proposal, who am
ready to confess that I know nothing on any subject
but love? Or how can Agathon, or Pausanias, or even
Aristophanes, whose life is one perpetual ministration to
Venus and Bacchus? Or how can any other whom I
see here? Though we who sit last are scarcely on an
equality with you; for if those who speak before us
shall have exhausted the subject with their eloquence
and reasonings, our discourses will be superfluous. But
in the name of Good Fortune, let Phædrus begin and
praise Love.” The whole party agreed to what Socrates
said, and entreated Phædrus to begin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>What each then said on this subject, Aristodemus
did not entirely recollect, nor do I recollect all that he
related to me; but only the speeches of those who said
what was most worthy of remembrance. First, then,
Phædrus began thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Love is a mighty deity, and the object of admiration,
both to Gods and men, for many and for various claims;
but especially on account of his origin. For that he is
to be honoured as one of the most ancient of the gods,
this may serve as a testimony, that Love has no parents,
nor is there any poet or other person who has ever
affirmed that there are such. Hesiod says, that first
‘Chaos was produced; then the broad-bosomed Earth,
to be a secure foundation for all things; then Love.’
He says that after Chaos these two were produced, the
Earth and Love. Parmenides, speaking of generation,
says:&mdash;‘But he created Love before any of the gods.’
Acusileus agrees with Hesiod. Love, therefore, is
universally acknowledged to be among the oldest of
things. And in addition to this, Love is the author of
our greatest advantages; for I cannot imagine a greater
happiness and advantage to one who is in the flower
of youth than an amiable lover, or to a lover, than
an amiable object of his love. For neither birth, nor
wealth, nor honours, can awaken in the minds of men
the principles which should guide those who from their
youth aspire to an honourable and excellent life, as
Love awakens them. I speak of the fear of shame,
which deters them from that which is disgraceful; and
the love of glory, which incites to honourable deeds.
For it is not possible that a state or private person
should accomplish, without these incitements, anything
beautiful or great. I assert, then, that should one who
loves be discovered in any dishonourable action, or
tamely enduring insult through cowardice, he would feel
more anguish and shame if observed by the object of
his passion, than if he were observed by his father, or<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
his companions, or any other person. In like manner,
among warmly attached friends, a man is especially
grieved to be discovered by his friend in any dishonourable
act. If, then, by any contrivance, a state or army
could be composed of friends bound by strong attachment,
it is beyond calculation how excellently they
would administer their affairs, refraining from anything
base, contending with each other for the acquirement
of fame, and exhibiting such valour in battle as that,
though few in numbers, they might subdue all mankind.
For should one friend desert the ranks or cast away his
arms in the presence of the other, he would suffer far
acuter shame from that one person’s regard, than from
the regard of all other men. A thousand times would
he prefer to die, rather than desert the object of his
attachment, and not succour him in danger.</p>

<p>“There is none so worthless whom Love cannot
impel, as it were by a divine inspiration, towards
virtue, even so that he may through this inspiration
become equal to one who might naturally be more
excellent; and, in truth, as Homer says: The God
breathes vigour into certain heroes&mdash;so Love breathes
into those who love, the spirit which is produced from
himself. Not only men, but even women who love,
are those alone who willingly expose themselves to
die for others. Alcestis, the daughter of Pelias, affords
to the Greeks a remarkable example of this opinion;
she alone being willing to die for her husband, and
so surpassing his parents in the affection with which
love inspired her towards him, as to make them appear,
in the comparison with her, strangers to their own
child, and related to him merely in name; and so
lovely and admirable did this action appear, not only
to men, but even to the Gods, that, although they
conceded the prerogative of bringing back the spirit
from death to few among the many who then performed
excellent and honourable deeds, yet, delighted with this<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
action, they redeemed her soul from the infernal regions:
so highly do the Gods honour zeal and devotion in love.
They sent back indeed Orpheus, the son of Œagrus,
from Hell, with his purpose unfulfilled, and, showing
him only the spectre of her for whom he came, refused
to render up herself. For Orpheus seemed to them,
not as Alcestis, to have dared die for the sake of her
whom he loved, and thus to secure to himself a perpetual
intercourse with her in the regions to which she
had preceded him, but like a cowardly musician, to
have contrived to descend alive into Hell; and, indeed,
they appointed as a punishment for his cowardice, that
he should be put to death by women.</p>

<p>“Far otherwise did they reward Achilles, the son of
Thetis, whom they sent to inhabit the islands of the
blessed. For Achilles, though informed by his mother
that his own death would ensue upon his killing Hector,
but that if he refrained from it he might return home
and die in old age, yet preferred revenging and honouring
his beloved Patroclus; not to die for him merely,
but to disdain and reject that life which he had ceased
to share. Therefore the Greeks honoured Achilles
beyond all other men, because he thus preferred his
friend to all things else.</p>

<p>“On this account have the Gods rewarded Achilles
more amply than Alcestis; permitting his spirit to
inhabit the islands of the blessed. Hence do I assert
that Love is the most ancient and venerable of deities,
and most powerful to endow mortals with the possession
of happiness and virtue, both whilst they live and after
they die.”</p>

<p>Thus Aristodemus reported the discourse of Phædrus;
and after Phædrus, he said that some others spoke, whose
discourses he did not well remember. When they had
ceased, Pausanias began thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Simply to praise Love, O Phædrus, seems to me
too bounded a scope for our discourse. If Love were<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
one, it would be well. But since Love is not one, I will
endeavour to distinguish which is the Love whom it
becomes us to praise, and having thus discriminated
one from the other, will attempt to render him who is
the subject of our discourse the honour due to his
divinity. We all know that Venus is never without
Love; and if Venus were one, Love would be one; but
since there are two Venuses, of necessity also must
there be two Loves. For assuredly are there two
Venuses; one, the eldest, the daughter of Uranus,
born without a mother, whom we call the Uranian;
the other younger, the daughter of Jupiter and Dione,
whom we call the Pandemian;&mdash;of necessity must there
also be two Loves, the Uranian and Pandemian companions
of these goddesses. It is becoming to praise
all the Gods, but the attributes which fall to the lot of
each may be distinguished and selected. For any particular
action whatever in itself is neither good nor
evil; what we are now doing&mdash;drinking, singing, talking,
none of these things are good in themselves, but
the mode in which they are done stamps them with
its own nature; and that which is done well, is good,
and that which is done ill, is evil. Thus, not all love,
nor every mode of love is beautiful, or worthy of commendation,
but that alone which excites us to love
worthily. The Love, therefore, which attends upon
Venus Pandemos is, in truth, common to the vulgar,
and presides over transient and fortuitous connexions,
and is worshipped by the least excellent of mankind.
The votaries of this deity seek the body rather than the
soul, and the ignorant rather than the wise, disdaining
all that is honourable and lovely, and considering how
they shall best satisfy their sensual necessities. This
Love is derived from the younger goddess, who partakes
in her nature both of male and female. But the attendant
on the other, the Uranian, whose nature is entirely
masculine, is the Love who inspires us with affection,<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
and exempts us from all wantonness and libertinism.
Those who are inspired by this divinity seek the affections
of those who are endowed by nature with greater
excellence and vigour both of body and mind. And it
is easy to distinguish those who especially exist under
the influence of this power, by their choosing in early
youth as the objects of their love those in whom the
intellectual faculties have begun to develop. For those
who begin to love in this manner seem to me to be
preparing to pass their whole life together in a community
of good and evil, and not ever lightly deceiving
those who love them, to be faithless to their vows.
There ought to be a law that none should love the very
young; so much serious affection as this deity enkindles
should not be doubtfully bestowed; for the body and
mind of those so young are yet unformed, and it is
difficult to foretell what will be their future tendencies
and power. The good voluntarily impose this law upon
themselves, and those vulgar lovers ought to be compelled
to the same observance, as we deter them with
all the power of the laws from the love of free matrons.
For these are the persons whose shameful actions
embolden those who observe their importunity and
intemperance to assert, that it is dishonourable to serve
and gratify the objects of our love. But no one who
does this gracefully and according to law, can justly be
liable to the imputation of blame.</p>

<p>“Not only friendship, but philosophy and the practice
of the gymnastic exercises, are represented as dishonourable
by the tyrannical governments under which the
barbarians live. For I imagine it would little conduce
to the benefit of the governors, that the governed should
be disciplined to lofty thoughts and to the unity and
communion of steadfast friendship, of which admirable
effects the tyrants of our own country have also learned
that Love is the author. For the love of Harmodius
and Aristogiton, strengthened into a firm friendship,<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
dissolved the tyranny. Wherever, therefore, it is
declared dishonourable in any case to serve and benefit
friends, that law is a mark of the depravity of the legislator,
the avarice and tyranny of the rulers, and the
cowardice of those who are ruled. Wherever it is simply
declared to be honourable without distinction of cases,
such a declaration denotes dulness and want of subtlety
of mind in the authors of the regulation. Here the
degrees of praise or blame to be attributed by law are
far better regulated; but it is yet difficult to determine
the cases to which they should refer.</p>

<p>“It is evident, however, for one in whom passion is
enkindled, it is more honourable to love openly than
secretly; and most honourable to love the most excellent
and virtuous, even if they should be less beautiful than
others. It is honourable for the lover to exhort and
sustain the object of his love in virtuous conduct. It is
considered honourable to attain the love of those whom
we seek, and the contrary shameful; and to facilitate
this attainment, opinion has given to the lover the permission
of acquiring favour by the most extraordinary
devices, which if a person should practise for any purpose
besides this, he would incur the severest reproof of
philosophy. For if any one desirous of accumulating
money, or ambitious of procuring power, or seeking any
other advantage, should, like a lover seeking to acquire
the favour of his beloved, employ prayers and entreaties
in his necessity, and swear such oaths as lovers swear,
and sleep before the threshold, and offer to subject
himself to such slavery as no slave even would endure;
he would be frustrated of the attainment of what he
sought, both by his enemies and friends, these reviling
him for his flattery, those sharply admonishing him,
and taking to themselves the shame of his servility.
But there is a certain grace in a lover who does all these
things, so that he alone may do them without dishonour.
It is commonly said that the Gods accord pardon to the<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
lover alone if he should break his oath, and that there
is no oath by Venus. Thus, as our law declares, both
gods and men have given to lovers all possible indulgence.</p>

<p>“The affair, however, I imagine, stands thus: As I
have before said, love cannot be considered in itself as
either honourable or dishonourable: if it is honourably
pursued, it is honourable; if dishonourably, dishonourable:
it is dishonourable basely to serve and gratify a
worthless person; it is honourable honourably to serve
a person of virtue. That Pandemic lover who loves
rather the body than the soul is worthless, nor can be
constant and consistent, since he has placed his
affections on that which has no stability. For as soon
as the flower of the form, which was the sole object
of his desire, has faded, then he departs and is seen no
more; bound by no faith nor shame of his many promises
and persuasions. But he who is the lover of
virtuous manners is constant during life, since he has
placed himself in harmony and desire with that which
is consistent with itself.</p>

<p>“These two classes of persons we ought to distinguish
with careful examination, so that we may serve and
converse with the one and avoid the other; determining,
by that inquiry, by what a man is attracted, and for
what the object of his love is dear to him. On the
same account it is considered as dishonourable to be
inspired with love at once, lest time should be wanting
to know and approve the character of the object. It is
considered dishonourable to be captivated by the allurements
of wealth and power, or terrified through injuries
to yield up the affections, or not to despise in the comparison
with an unconstrained choice all political influence
and personal advantage. For no circumstance
is there in wealth or power so invariable and consistent,
as that no generous friendship can ever spring up from
amongst them. We have an opinion with respect to<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
lovers which declares that it shall not be considered
servile or disgraceful, though the lover should submit
himself to any species of slavery for the sake of his
beloved. The same opinion holds with respect to those
who undergo any degradation for the sake of virtue.
And also it is esteemed among us, that if any one
chooses to serve and obey another for the purpose of
becoming more wise or more virtuous through the intercourse
that might thence arise, such willing slavery
is not the slavery of a dishonest flatterer. Through
this we should consider in the same light a servitude
undertaken for the sake of love as one undertaken for
the acquirement of wisdom or any other excellence, if
indeed the devotion of a lover to his beloved is to be
considered a beautiful thing. For when the lover and
the beloved have once arrived at the same point, the
province of each being distinguished; the one able
to assist in the cultivation of the mind and in the
acquirement of every other excellence; the other yet
requiring education, and seeking the possession of
wisdom; then alone, by the union of these conditions,
and in no other case, is it honourable for the beloved
to yield up the affections to the lover. In this servitude
alone there is no disgrace in being deceived and defeated
of the object for which it was undertaken, whereas
every other is disgraceful, whether we are deceived
or no.</p>

<p>“On the same principle, if any one seeks the friendship
of another, believing him to be virtuous, for the
sake of becoming better through such intercourse and
affection, and is deceived, his friend turning out to be
worthless, and far from the possession of virtue; yet
it is honourable to have been so deceived. For such
a one seems to have submitted to a kind of servitude,
because he would endure anything for the sake of becoming
more virtuous and wise; a disposition of mind
eminently beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>“This is that Love who attends on the Uranian deity,
and is Uranian; the author of innumerable benefits
both to the state and to individuals, and by the necessity
of whose influence those who love are disciplined into
the zeal of virtue. All other loves are the attendants on
Venus Pandemos. So much, although unpremeditated,
is what I have to deliver on the subject of love, O
Phædrus.”</p>

<p>Pausanias having ceased (for so the learned teach
me to denote the changes of the discourse), Aristodemus
said that it came to the turn of Aristophanes to speak;
but it happened that, from repletion or some other cause,
he had an hiccough which prevented him; so he turned
to Eryximachus, the physician, who was reclining close
beside him, and said&mdash;“Eryximachus, it is but fair that
you should cure my hiccough, or speak instead of me
until it is over.”&mdash;“I will do both,” said Eryximachus;
“I will speak in your turn, and you, when your hiccough
has ceased, shall speak in mine. Meanwhile, if you
hold your breath some time, it will subside. If not,
gargle your throat with water; and if it still continue,
take something to stimulate your nostrils, and sneeze;
do this once or twice, and even though it should be very
violent it will cease.”&mdash;“Whilst you speak,” said
Aristophanes, “I will follow your directions.”&mdash;Eryximachus
then began:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Since Pausanias, beginning his discourse excellently,
placed no fit completion and development to it, I think
it necessary to attempt to fill up what he has left unfinished.
He has reasoned well in defining love as of a
double nature. The science of medicine, to which I
have addicted myself, seems to teach me that the love
which impels towards those who are beautiful, does not
subsist only in the souls of men, but in the bodies also
of those of all other living beings which are produced
upon earth, and, in a word, in all things which are. So
wonderful and mighty is this divinity, and so widely is<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
his influence extended over all divine and human things!
For the honour of my profession, I will begin by adducing
a proof from medicine. The nature of the body
contains within itself this double love. For that which
is healthy and that which is diseased in a body differ
and are unlike: that which is unlike loves and desires
that which is unlike. Love, therefore, is different in a
sane and in a diseased body. Pausanias has asserted
rightly that it is honourable to gratify those things in
the body which are good and healthy, and in this consists
the skill of the physician; whilst those which are
bad and diseased ought to be treated with no indulgence.
The science of medicine, in a word, is a knowledge of
the love affairs of the body, as they bear relation to
repletion and evacuation; and he is the most skilful
physician who can trace those operations of the good
and evil love, can make the one change places with the
other, and attract love into those parts from which he is
absent, or expel him from those which he ought not to
occupy. He ought to make those things which are
most inimical, friendly, and excite them to mutual love.
But those things are most inimical which are most
opposite to each other; cold to heat, bitterness to sweetness,
dryness to moisture. Our progenitor, Æsculapius,
as the poets inform us, (and indeed I believe them,)
through the skill which he possessed to inspire love and
concord in these contending principles, established the
science of medicine.</p>

<p>“The gymnastic arts and agriculture, no less than
medicine, are exercised under the dominion of this God.
Music, as any one may perceive who yields a very
slight attention to the subject, originates from the same
source; which Heraclitus probably meant, though he
could not express his meaning very clearly in words,
when he says, ‘One though apparently differing, yet so
agrees with itself, as the harmony of a lyre and a bow.’
It is great absurdity to say that a harmony differs, and<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
can exist between things whilst they are dissimilar; but
probably he meant that from sounds which first differed,
like the grave and the acute, and which afterwards
agreed, harmony was produced according to musical
art. For no harmony can arise from the grave and the
acute whilst yet they differ. But harmony is symphony:
symphony is, as it were, concord. But it is impossible
that concord should subsist between things that differ,
so long as they differ. Between things which are discordant
and dissimilar there is then no harmony. A
rhythm is produced from that which is quick, and that
which is slow, first being distinguished and opposed to
each other, and then made accordant; so does medicine,
no less than music, establish a concord between the
objects of its art, producing love and agreement between
adverse things.</p>

<p>“Music is then the knowledge of that which relates
to love in harmony and system. In the very system of
harmony and rhythm, it is easy to distinguish love.
The double love is not distinguishable in music itself;
but it is required to apply it to the service of mankind
by system and harmony, which is called poetry, or the
composition of melody; or by the correct use of songs
and measures already composed, which is called discipline;
then one can be distinguished from the other, by
the aid of an extremely skilful artist. And the better
love ought to be honoured and preserved for the sake of
those who are virtuous, and that the nature of the
vicious may be changed through the inspiration of its
spirit. This is that beautiful Uranian love, the attendant
on the Uranian muse: the Pandemian is the attendant
of Polyhymnia; to whose influence we should only so
far subject ourselves, as to derive pleasure from it without
indulging to excess; in the same manner as, according
to our art, we are instructed to seek the pleasures
of the table, only so far as we can enjoy them without
the consequences of disease. In music, therefore, and<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
in medicine, and in all other things, human and divine,
this double love ought to be traced and discriminated;
for it is in all things.</p>

<p>“Even the constitution of the seasons of the year is
penetrated with these contending principles. For so
often as heat and cold, dryness and moisture, of which
I spoke before, are influenced by the more benignant
love, and are harmoniously and temperately intermingled
with the seasons, they bring maturity and
health to men, and to all the other animals and plants.
But when the evil and injurious love assumes the
dominion of the seasons of the year, destruction is
spread widely abroad. Then pestilence is accustomed
to arise, and many other blights and diseases fall upon
animals and plants: and hoar frosts, and hails, and
mildew on the corn, are produced from that excessive
and disorderly love, with which each season of the year
is impelled towards the other; the motions of which
and the knowledge of the stars, is called astronomy.
All sacrifices, and all those things in which divination
is concerned (for these things are the links by which
is maintained an intercourse and communion between
the Gods and men), are nothing else than the science
of preservation and right government of Love. For
impiety is accustomed to spring up, so soon as any one
ceases to serve the more honourable Love, and worship
him by the sacrifice of good actions; but submits himself
to the influences of the other, in relation to his duties
towards his parents, and the Gods, and the living, and
the dead. It is the object of divination to distinguish
and remedy the effects of these opposite loves; and
divination is therefore the author of the friendship
of Gods and men, because it affords the knowledge of
what in matters of love is lawful or unlawful to men.</p>

<p>“Thus every species of love possesses collectively
a various and vast, or rather universal power. But
love which incites to the acquirement of its objects<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
according to virtue and wisdom, possesses the most
exclusive dominion, and prepares for his worshippers
the highest happiness through the mutual intercourse
of social kindness which it promotes among them, and
through the benevolence which he attracts to them from
the Gods, our superiors.</p>

<p>“Probably in thus praising Love, I have unwillingly
omitted many things; but it is your business,
O Aristophanes, to fill up all that I have left incomplete;
or, if you have imagined any other mode of
honouring the divinity: for I observe your hiccough
is over.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Aristophanes, “but not before I applied
the sneezing. I wonder why the harmonious construction
of our body should require such noisy operations
as sneezing; for it ceased the moment I sneezed.”&mdash;“Do
you not observe what you do, my good Aristophanes?”
said Eryximachus; “you are going to speak,
and you predispose us to laughter, and compel me to
watch for the first ridiculous idea which you may start
in your discourse, when you might have spoken in peace.”&mdash;“Let
me unsay what I have said, then,” replied
Aristophanes, laughing. “Do not watch me, I entreat
you; though I am not afraid of saying what is laughable
(since that would be all gain, and quite in the
accustomed spirit of my muse), but lest I should say
what is ridiculous.”&mdash;“Do you think to throw your
dart, and escape with impunity, Aristophanes? Attend,
and what you say be careful you maintain; then, perhaps,
if it pleases me, I may dismiss you without
question.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, Eryximachus,” proceeded Aristophanes, “I
have designed that my discourse should be very different
from yours and that of Pausanias. It seems to me that
mankind are by no means penetrated with a conception
of the power of Love, or they would have built sumptuous
temples and altars, and have established magnificent<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
rites of sacrifice in his honour; he deserves worship
and homage more than all the other Gods, and he has
yet received none. For Love is of all the Gods the
most friendly to mortals; and the physician of those
wounds, whose cure would be the greatest happiness
which could be conferred upon the human race. I will
endeavour to unfold to you his true power, and you can
relate what I declare to others.</p>

<p>“You ought first to know the nature of man, and the
adventures he has gone through; for his nature was
anciently far different from that which it is at present.
First, then, human beings were formerly not divided
into two sexes, male and female; there was also a third,
common to both the others, the name of which remains,
though the sex itself has disappeared. The androgynous
sex, both in appearance and in name, was common both
to male and female; its name alone remains, which
labours under a reproach.</p>

<p>“At the period to which I refer, the form of every
human being was round, the back and the sides being
circularly joined, and each had four arms and as many
legs; two faces fixed upon a round neck, exactly like
each other; one head between the two faces; four ears,
and everything else as from such proportions it is easy
to conjecture. Man walked upright as now, in whatever
direction he pleased; but when he wished to go fast he
made use of all his eight limbs, and proceeded in a
rapid motion by rolling circularly round,&mdash;like tumblers,
who, with their legs in the air, tumble round and round.
We account for the production of three sexes by supposing
that, at the beginning, the male was produced
from the sun, the female from the earth; and that sex
which participated in both sexes, from the moon, by
reason of the androgynous nature of the moon. They
were round, and their mode of proceeding was round,
from the similarity which must needs subsist between
them and their parent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>“They were strong also, and had aspiring thoughts.
They it was who levied war against the Gods; and
what Homer writes concerning Ephialtus and Otus, that
they sought to ascend heaven and dethrone the Gods, in
reality relates to this primitive people. Jupiter and the
other Gods debated what was to be done in this emergency.
For neither could they prevail on themselves to
destroy them, as they had the giants, with thunder, so
that the race should be abolished; for in that case they
would be deprived of the honours of the sacrifices which
they were in the custom of receiving from them; nor
could they permit a continuance of their insolence and
impiety. Jupiter, with some difficulty having desired
silence, at length spoke. ‘I think,’ said he, ‘I have
contrived a method by which we may, by rendering the
human race more feeble, quell the insolence which they
exercise, without proceeding to their utter destruction.
I will cut each of them in half; and so they will at once
be weaker and more useful on account of their numbers.
They shall walk upright on two legs. If they show any
more insolence, and will not keep quiet, I will cut them
up in half again, so they shall go about hopping on one
leg.’</p>

<p>“So saying, he cut human beings in half, as people
cut eggs before they salt them, or as I have seen eggs
cut with hairs. He ordered Apollo to take each one
as he cut him, and turn his face and half his neck
towards the operation, so that by contemplating it he
might become more cautious and humble; and then, to
cure him, Apollo turned the face round, and drawing
the skin upon what we now call the belly, like a contracted
pouch, and leaving one opening, that which is
called the navel, tied it in the middle. He then
smoothed many other wrinkles, and moulded the breast
with much such an instrument as the leather-cutters use
to smooth the skins upon the block. He left only a few
wrinkles in the belly, near the navel, to serve as a record<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
of its former adventure. Immediately after this division,
as each desired to possess the other half of himself, these
divided people threw their arms around and embraced
each other, seeking to grow together; and from this
resolution to do nothing without the other half, they died
of hunger and weakness: when one half died and the
other was left alive, that which was thus left sought the
other and folded it to its bosom; whether that half were
an entire woman (for we now call it a woman) or a man;
and thus they perished. But Jupiter, pitying them,
thought of another contrivance. In this manner is
generation now produced, by the union of male and
female; so that from the embrace of a man and woman
the race is propagated.</p>

<p>“From this period, mutual love has naturally existed
between human beings; that reconciler and bond of
union of their original nature, which seeks to make two
one, and to heal the divided nature of man. Every one
of us is thus the half of what may be properly termed a
man, and like a pselta cut in two, is the imperfect portion
of an entire whole, perpetually necessitated to seek the
half belonging to him.</p>

<p>“Such as I have described is ever an affectionate
lover and a faithful friend, delighting in that which is in
conformity with his own nature. Whenever, therefore,
any such as I have described are impetuously struck,
through the sentiment of their former union, with love
and desire and the want of community, they are unwilling
to be divided even for a moment. These are
they who devote their whole lives to each other, with a
vain and inexpressible longing to obtain from each other
something they know not what; for it is not merely the
sensual delights of their intercourse for the sake of which
they dedicate themselves to each other with such serious
affection; but the soul of each manifestly thirsts for,
from the other, something which there are no words to
describe, and divines that which it seeks, and traces<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
obscurely the footsteps of its obscure desire. If Vulcan
should say to persons thus affected, ‘My good people,
what is it that you want with one another?’ And if,
while they were hesitating what to answer, he should
proceed to ask, ‘Do you not desire the closest union
and singleness to exist between you, so that you may
never be divided night or day? If so, I will melt you
together, and make you grow into one, so that both in
life and death ye may be undivided. Consider, is this
what you desire? Will it content you if you become
that which I propose?’ We all know that no one would
refuse such an offer, but would at once feel that this was
what he had ever sought; and intimately to mix and
melt and to be melted together with his beloved, so that
one should be made out of two.</p>

<p>“The cause of this desire is, that according to our
original nature, we were once entire. The desire and
the pursuit of integrity and union is that which we all
love. First, as I said, we were entire, but now we
have been dwindled through our own weakness, as the
Arcadians by the Lacedemonians. There is reason to
fear, if we are guilty of any additional impiety towards
the Gods, that we may be cut in two again, and may go
about like those figures painted on the columns, divided
through the middle of our nostrils, as thin as lispæ.
On which account every man ought to be exhorted to
pay due reverence to the Gods, that we may escape so
severe a punishment, and obtain those things which
Love, our general and commander, incites us to desire;
against whom let none rebel by exciting the hatred of
the Gods. For if we continue on good terms with them,
we may discover and possess those lost and concealed
objects of our love; a good-fortune which now befalls to
few.</p>

<p>“I assert, then, that the happiness of all, both men
and women, consists singly in the fulfilment of their
love, and in that possession of its objects by which we<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
are in some degree restored to our ancient nature. If
this be the completion of felicity, that must necessarily
approach nearest to it, in which we obtain the possession
and society of those whose natures most intimately
accord with our own. And if we would celebrate any
God as the author of this benefit, we should justly celebrate
Love with hymns of joy; who, in our present condition,
brings good assistance in our necessity, and affords
great hopes, if we persevere in piety towards the Gods,
that he will restore us to our original state, and confer
on us the complete happiness alone suited to our nature.</p>

<p>“Such, Eryximachus, is my discourse on the subject
of Love; different indeed from yours, which I nevertheless
entreat you not to turn into ridicule, that we may
not interrupt what each has separately to deliver on the
subject.”</p>

<p>“I will refrain at present,” said Eryximachus, “for
your discourse delighted me. And if I did not know
that Socrates and Agathon were profoundly versed in
the science of love affairs, I should fear that they had
nothing new to say, after so many and such various
imaginations. As it is, I confide in the fertility of their
geniuses.”&mdash;“Your part of the contest, at least, was
strenuously fought, Eryximachus,” said Socrates, “but
if you had been in the situation in which I am, or rather
shall be, after the discourse of Agathon, like me, you
would then have reason to fear, and be reduced to your
wits’ end.”&mdash;“Socrates,” said Agathon, “wishes to confuse
me with the enchantments of his wit, sufficiently
confused already with the expectation I see in the
assembly in favour of my discourse.”&mdash;“I must have
lost my memory, Agathon,” replied Socrates, “if I
imagine that you could be disturbed by a few private
persons, after having witnessed your firmness and
courage in ascending the rostrum with the actors, and
in calmly reciting your compositions in the presence of
so great an assembly as that which decreed you the<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
prize of tragedy.”&mdash;“What then, Socrates,” retorted
Agathon, “do you think me so full of the theatre as to
be ignorant that the judgment of a few wise is more
awful than that of a multitude of others, to one who
rightly balances the value of their suffrages?”&mdash;“I
should judge ill indeed, Agathon,” answered Socrates,
“in thinking you capable of any rude and unrefined
conception, for I well know that if you meet with any
whom you consider wise, you esteem such alone of more
value than all others. But we are far from being
entitled to this distinction, for we were also of that
assembly, and to be numbered among the rest. But
should you meet with any who are really wise, you
would be careful to say nothing in their presence which
you thought they would not approve&mdash;is it not so?”&mdash;“Certainly,”
replied Agathon.&mdash;“You would not then
exercise the same caution in the presence of the multitude
in which they were included?”&mdash;“My dear Agathon,”
said Phædrus, interrupting him, “if you answer all the
questions of Socrates, they will never have an end; he
will urge them without conscience so long as he can get
any person, especially one who is so beautiful, to dispute
with him. I own it delights me to hear Socrates
discuss; but at present, I must see that Love is not
defrauded of the praise, which it is my province to exact
from each of you. Pay the God his due, and then
reason between yourselves if you will.”</p>

<p>“Your admonition is just, Phædrus,” replied Agathon,
“nor need any reasoning I hold with Socrates impede
me: we shall find many future opportunities for discussion.
I will begin my discourse then; first having
defined what ought to be the subject of it. All who
have already spoken seem to me not so much to have
praised Love, as to have felicitated mankind on the
many advantages of which that deity is the cause; what
he is, the author of these great benefits, none have yet
declared. There is one mode alone of celebration which<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
would comprehend the whole topic, namely, first to
declare what are those benefits, and then what he is
who is the author of those benefits, which are the subject
of our discourse. Love ought first to be praised, and
then his gifts declared. I assert, then, that although
all the Gods are immortally happy, Love, if I dare
trust my voice to express so awful a truth, is the happiest,
and most excellent, and the most beautiful. That he is
the most beautiful is evident; first, O Phædrus, from
this circumstance, that he is the youngest of the Gods;
and, secondly, from his fleetness, and from his repugnance
to all that is old; for he escapes with the swiftness
of wings from old age; a thing in itself sufficiently swift,
since it overtakes us sooner than there is need; and
which Love, who delights in the intercourse of the
young, hates, and in no manner can be induced to enter
into community with. The ancient proverb, which says
that like is attracted by like, applies to the attributes
of Love. I concede many things to you, O Phædrus,
but this I do not concede, that Love is more ancient
than Saturn and Jupiter. I assert that he is not only
the youngest of the Gods, but invested with everlasting
youth. Those ancient deeds among the Gods recorded
by Hesiod and Parmenides, if their relations are to be
considered as true, were produced not by Love, but by
Necessity. For if Love had been then in Heaven, those
violent and sanguinary crimes never would have taken
place; but there would ever have subsisted that affection
and peace, in which the Gods now live, under the
influence of Love.</p>

<p>“He is young, therefore, and being young is tender
and soft. There were need of some poet like Homer
to celebrate the delicacy and tenderness of Love. For
Homer says, that the goddess Calamity is delicate, and
that her feet are tender. ‘Her feet are soft,’ he says,
‘for she treads not upon the ground, but makes her path
upon the heads of men.’ He gives as an evidence of<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
her tenderness, that she walks not upon that which is
hard, but that which is soft. The same evidence is
sufficient to make manifest the tenderness of Love. For
Love walks not upon the earth, nor over the heads of
men, which are not indeed very soft; but he dwells
within, and treads on the softest of existing things,
having established his habitation within the souls and
inmost nature of Gods and men; not indeed in all souls&mdash;for
wherever he chances to find a hard and rugged
disposition, there he will not inhabit, but only where it
is most soft and tender. Of needs must he be the
most delicate of all things, who touches lightly with his
feet only the softest parts of those things which are the
softest of all.</p>

<p>“He is then the youngest and the most delicate of
all divinities; and in addition to this, he is, as it were,
the most moist and liquid. For if he were otherwise,
he could not, as he does, fold himself around everything,
and secretly flow out and into every soul. His
loveliness, that which Love possesses far beyond all
other things, is a manifestation of the liquid and flowing
symmetry of his form; for between deformity and Love
there is eternal contrast and repugnance. His life is spent
among flowers, and this accounts for the immortal fairness
of his skin; for the winged Love rests not in
his flight on any form, or within any soul the flower
of whose loveliness is faded, but there remains most
willingly where is the odour and radiance of blossoms,
yet unwithered. Concerning the beauty of the God, let
this be sufficient, though many things must remain unsaid.
Let us next consider the virtue and power of
Love.</p>

<p>“What is most admirable in Love is, that he neither
inflicts nor endures injury in his relations either with
Gods or men. Nor if he suffers any thing does he suffer
it through violence, nor doing any thing does he act it
with violence, for Love is never even touched with<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
violence. Every one willingly administers every thing to
Love; and that which every one voluntarily concedes
to another, the laws, which are the kings of the republic,
decree that is just for him to possess. In addition to
justice, Love participates in the highest temperance;
for if temperance is defined to be the being superior to
and holding under dominion pleasures and desires;
then Love, than whom no pleasure is more powerful,
and who is thus more powerful than all persuasions and
delights, must be excellently temperate. In power and
valour Mars cannot contend with Love: the love of
Venus possesses Mars; the possessor is always superior
to the possessed, and he who subdues the most powerful
must of necessity be the most powerful of all.</p>

<p>“The justice and temperance and valour of the God
have been thus declared;&mdash;there remains to exhibit his
wisdom. And first, that, like Eryximachus, I may
honour my own profession, the God is a wise poet;
so wise that he can even make a poet one who was
not before: for every one, even if before he were ever
so undisciplined, becomes a poet as soon as he is
touched by Love;&mdash;a sufficient proof that Love is a
great poet, and well skilled in that science according
to the discipline of music. For what any one possesses
not, or knows not, that can he neither give nor teach
another. And who will deny that the divine poetry,
by which all living things are produced upon the earth,
is not harmonised by the wisdom of Love? Is it not
evident that Love was the author of all the arts of life
with which we are acquainted, and that he whose teacher
has been Love, becomes eminent and illustrious, whilst
he who knows not Love, remains forever unregarded and
obscure? Apollo invented medicine, and divination,
and archery, under the guidance of desire and Love;
so that Apollo was the disciple of Love. Through him
the Muses discovered the arts of literature, and Vulcan
that of moulding brass, and Minerva the loom, and<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
Jupiter the mystery of the dominion which he now
exercises over gods and men. So were the Gods taught
and disciplined by the love of that which is beautiful;
for there is no love towards deformity.</p>

<p>“At the origin of things, as I have before said, many
fearful deeds are reported to have been done among the
Gods, on account of the dominion of Necessity. But
so soon as this deity sprang forth from the desire which
forever tends in the universe towards that which is lovely,
then all blessings descended upon all living things,
human and divine. Love seems to me, O Phædrus, a
divinity the most beautiful and the best of all, and the
author to all others of the excellencies with which his
own nature is endowed. Nor can I restrain the poetic
enthusiasm which takes possession of my discourse, and
bids me declare that Love is the divinity who creates
peace among men, and calm upon the sea, the windless
silence of storms, repose and sleep in sadness. Love
divests us of all alienation from each other, and fills our
vacant hearts with overflowing sympathy; he gathers us
together in such social meetings as we now delight to
celebrate, our guardian and our guide in dances, and
sacrifices, and feasts. Yes, Love, who showers benignity
upon the world, and before whose presence all
harsh passions flee and perish; the author of all soft
affections; the destroyer of all ungentle thoughts; merciful,
mild; the object of the admiration of the wise, and
the delight of gods; possessed by the fortunate, and
desired by the unhappy, therefore unhappy because they
possess him not; the father of grace, and delicacy, and
gentleness, and delight, and persuasion, and desire; the
cherisher of all that is good, the abolisher of all evil;
our most excellent pilot, defence, saviour and guardian
in labour and in fear, in desire and in reason; the
ornament and governor of all things human and divine;
the best, the loveliest; in whose footsteps every one
ought to follow, celebrating him excellently in song, and<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
bearing each his part in that divinest harmony which
Love sings to all things which live and are, soothing
the troubled minds of Gods and men. This, O Phædrus,
is what I have to offer in praise of the divinity; partly
composed, indeed, of thoughtless and playful fancies,
and partly of such serious ones as I could well command.”</p>

<p>No sooner had Agathon ceased, than a loud murmur
of applause arose from all present; so becomingly had
the fair youth spoken, both in praise of the God, and
in extenuation of himself. Then Socrates, addressing
Eryximachus, said, “Was not my fear reasonable, son
of Acumenus? Did I not divine what has, in fact,
happened,&mdash;that Agathon’s discourse would be so wonderfully
beautiful, as to preoccupy all interest in what
I should say?”&mdash;“You, indeed, divined well so far,
O Socrates,” said Eryximachus, “that Agathon would
speak eloquently, but not that, therefore, you would be
reduced to any difficulty.”&mdash;“How, my good friend,
can I or any one else be otherwise than reduced to
difficulty, who speak after a discourse so various and
so eloquent, and which otherwise had been sufficiently
wonderful, if, at the conclusion, the splendour of the
sentences, and the choice selection of the expressions,
had not struck all the hearers with astonishment; so
that I, who well know that I can never say anything
nearly so beautiful as this, would, if there had been any
escape, have run away for shame. The story of Gorgias
came into my mind, and I was afraid lest in
reality I should suffer what Homer describes; and lest
Agathon, scanning my discourse with the head of the
eloquent Gorgias, should turn me to stone for speechlessness.
I immediately perceived how ridiculously I
had engaged myself with you to assume a part in
rendering praise to love, and had boasted that I was
well skilled in amatory matters, being so ignorant of
the manner in which it is becoming to render him<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
honour, as I now perceive myself to be. I, in my
simplicity, imagined that the truth ought to be spoken
concerning each of the topics of our praise, and that it
would be sufficient, choosing those which are the most
honourable to the God, to place them in as luminous an
arrangement as we could. I had, therefore, great hopes
that I should speak satisfactorily, being well aware that
I was acquainted with the true foundations of the praise
which we have engaged to render. But since, as it
appears, our purpose has been, not to render Love his
due honour, but to accumulate the most beautiful and
the greatest attributes of his divinity, whether they in
truth belong to it or not, and that the proposed question
is not how Love ought to be praised, but how we should
praise him most eloquently, my attempt must of necessity
fail. It is on this account, I imagine, that in your discourses
you have attributed everything to Love, and
have described him to be the author of such and so
great effects as, to those who are ignorant of his true
nature, may exhibit him as the most beautiful and the
best of all things. Not, indeed, to those who know the
truth. Such praise has a splendid and imposing effect,
but as I am unacquainted with the art of rendering
it, my mind, which could not foresee what would be
required of me, absolves me from that which my tongue
promised. Farewell, then, for such praise I can never
render.</p>

<p>“But if you desire, I will speak what I feel to be
true; and that I may not expose myself to ridicule,
I entreat you to consider that I speak without entering
into competition with those who have preceded me.
Consider, then, Phædrus, whether you will exact from
me such a discourse, containing the mere truth with
respect to Love, and composed of such unpremeditated
expressions as may chance to offer themselves to my
mind.”&mdash;Phædrus and the rest bade him speak in the
manner which he judged most befitting.&mdash;“Permit me,<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
then, O Phædrus, to ask Agathon a few questions, so
that, confirmed by his agreement with me, I may proceed.”&mdash;“Willingly,”
replied Phædrus, “ask.”&mdash;Then
Socrates thus began:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I applaud, dear Agathon, the beginning of your
discourse, where you say we ought first to define and
declare what Love is, and then his works. This rule
I particularly approve. But, come, since you have
given us a discourse of such beauty and majesty concerning
Love, you are able, I doubt not, to explain this
question, whether Love is the love of something or
nothing? I do not ask you of what parents Love is;
for the inquiry, of whether Love is the love of any
father or mother, would be sufficiently ridiculous. But
if I were asking you to describe that which a father
is, I should ask, not whether a father was the love of
any one, but whether a father was the father of any one
or not; you would undoubtedly reply, that a father was
the father of a son or daughter; would you not?”&mdash;“Assuredly.”&mdash;“You
would define a mother in the
same manner?”&mdash;“Without doubt.”&mdash;“Yet bear
with me, and answer a few more questions, for I would
learn from you that which I wish to know. If I should
inquire, in addition, is not a brother, through the very
nature of his relation, the brother of some one?”&mdash;“Certainly.”&mdash;“Of
a brother or sister, is he not?”&mdash;“Without
question.”&mdash;“Try to explain to me then the
nature of Love; Love is the love of something or
nothing?”&mdash;“Of something, certainly.”</p>

<p>“Observe and remember this concession. Tell me
yet farther, whether Love desires that of which it is the
Love or not?”&mdash;“It desires it, assuredly.”&mdash;“Whether
possessing that which it desires and loves, or not
possessing it, does it desire and love?”&mdash;“Not possessing
it, I should imagine.”&mdash;“Observe now, whether it
does not appear, that, of necessity, desire desires that
which it wants and does not possess, and no longer<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
desires that which it no longer wants: this appears to
me, Agathon, of necessity to be; how does it appear to
you?”&mdash;“It appears so to me also.”&mdash;“Would any one
who was already illustrious, desire to be illustrious;
would any one already strong, desire to be strong?
From what has already been conceded, it follows that
he would not. If any one already strong, should desire
to be strong; or any one already swift, should desire to
be swift; or any one already healthy, should desire to
be healthy, it must be concluded that they still desired
the advantages of which they already seemed possessed.
To destroy the foundation of this error, observe, Agathon,
that each of these persons must possess the several
advantages in question, at the moment present to our
thoughts, whether he will or no. And, now, is it
possible that those advantages should be at that time
the objects of his desire? For, if any one should say,
being in health, ‘I desire to be in health;’ being rich,
‘I desire to be rich, and thus still desire those things
which I already possess;’ we might say to him, ‘You,
my friend, possess health, and strength, and riches;
you do not desire to possess now, but to continue to
possess them in future; for, whether you will or no,
they now belong to you. Consider then, whether, when
you say that you desire things present to you, and in
your own possession, you say anything else than that
you desire the advantages to be for the future also in
your possession.’ What else could he reply?”&mdash;“Nothing,
indeed.”&mdash;“Is not Love, then, the love
of that which is not within its reach, and which cannot
hold in security, for the future, those things of which
it obtains a present and transitory possession?”&mdash;“Evidently.”&mdash;“Love,
therefore, and everything else
that desires anything, desires that which is absent and
beyond his reach, that which it has not, that which is
not itself, that which it wants; such are the things of
which there are desire and love?”&mdash;“Assuredly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>“Come,” said Socrates, “let us review your concessions.
Is Love anything else than the love first of
something; and, secondly, of those things of which it
has need?”&mdash;“Nothing.”&mdash;“Now, remember of those
things you said in your discourse, that Love was the
love&mdash;if you wish I will remind you. I think you said
something of this kind, that all the affairs of the gods
were admirably disposed through the love of the things
which are beautiful; for, there was no love of things
deformed; did you not say so?”&mdash;“I confess that I
did.”&mdash;“You said what was most likely to be true, my
friend; and if the matter be so, the love of beauty must
be one thing, and the love of deformity another.”&mdash;“Certainly.”&mdash;“It
is conceded, then, that Love loves
that which he wants but possesses not?”&mdash;“Yes, certainly.”&mdash;“But
Love wants and does not possess
beauty?”&mdash;“Indeed it must necessarily follow.”&mdash;“What,
then! call you that beautiful which has need
of beauty and possesses not?”&mdash;“Assuredly no.”&mdash;“Do
you still assert, then, that Love is beautiful, if all that
we have said be true?”&mdash;“Indeed, Socrates,” said
Agathon, “I am in danger of being convicted of
ignorance, with respect to all that I then spoke.”&mdash;“You
spoke most eloquently, my dear Agathon; but
bear with my questions yet a moment. You admit that
things which are good are also beautiful?”&mdash;“No
doubt.”&mdash;“If Love, then, be in want of beautiful things,
and things which are good are beautiful, he must be
in want of things which are good?”&mdash;“I cannot refute
your arguments, Socrates.”&mdash;“You cannot refute truth,
my dear Agathon: to refute Socrates is nothing difficult.</p>

<p>“But I will dismiss these questionings. At present
let me endeavour, to the best of my power, to repeat to
you, on the basis of the points which have been agreed
upon between me and Agathon, a discourse concerning
Love, which I formerly heard from the prophetess
Diotima, who was profoundly skilled in this and many<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
other doctrines, and who, ten years before the pestilence,
procured to the Athenians, through their sacrifices, a
delay of the disease; for it was she who taught me the
science of things relating to Love.</p>

<p>“As you well remarked, Agathon, we ought to declare
who and what is Love, and then his works. It is
easiest to relate them in the same order as the foreign
prophetess observed when, questioning me, she related
them. For I said to her much the same things that
Agathon has just said to me&mdash;that Love was a great
deity, and that he was beautiful; and she refuted me
with the same reasons as I have employed to refute
Agathon, compelling me to infer that he was neither
beautiful nor good, as I said.&mdash;‘What then,’ I objected,
‘O Diotima, is Love ugly and evil?’&mdash;‘Good words, I
entreat you,’ said Diotima; ‘do you think that every
thing which is not beautiful, must of necessity be ugly?’&mdash;‘Certainly.’&mdash;‘And
everything that is not wise,
ignorant? Do you not perceive that there is something
between ignorance and wisdom?’&mdash;‘What is that?’&mdash;‘To
have a right opinion or conjecture. Observe, that
this kind of opinion, for which no reason can be rendered,
cannot be called knowledge; for how can that be called
knowledge, which is without evidence or reason? Nor
ignorance, on the other hand; for how can that be
called ignorance which arrives at the persuasion of that
which it really is? A right opinion is something
between understanding and ignorance.’&mdash;I confessed
that what she alleged was true.&mdash;‘Do not then say,’ she
continued, ‘that what is not beautiful is of necessity
deformed, nor what is not good is of necessity evil;
nor, since you have confessed that Love is neither
beautiful nor good, infer, therefore, that he is deformed
or evil, but rather something intermediate.’</p>

<p>“‘But,’ I said, ‘love is confessed by all to be a great
God.’&mdash;‘Do you mean, when you say all, all those who
know, or those who know not, what they say?’&mdash;‘All<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
collectively.’&mdash;‘And how can that be, Socrates?’ said
she laughing; ‘how can he be acknowledged to be a
great God, by those who assert that he is not even a
God at all?’&mdash;‘And who are they?’ I said&mdash;‘You for
one, and I for another.’&mdash;‘How can you say that,
Diotima?’&mdash;‘Easily,’ she replied, ‘and with truth; for
tell me, do you not own that all the Gods are beautiful
and happy? or will you presume to maintain that any
God is otherwise?’&mdash;‘By Jupiter, not I!’&mdash;‘Do you not
call those alone happy who possess all things that are
beautiful and good?’&mdash;‘Certainly.’&mdash;‘You have confessed
that Love, through his desire for things beautiful
and good, possesses not those materials of happiness.’&mdash;‘Indeed
such was my concession.’&mdash;‘But how can we
conceive a God to be without the possession of what is
beautiful and good?’&mdash;‘In no manner, I confess.’&mdash;‘Observe,
then, that you do not consider Love to be a
God.’&mdash;‘What, then,’ I said, ‘is Love a mortal?’&mdash;‘By
no means.’&mdash;‘But what, then?’&mdash;‘Like those
things which I have before instanced, he is neither
mortal nor immortal, but something intermediate.’&mdash;‘What
is that, O Diotima?’&mdash;‘A great dæmon,
Socrates; and everything dæmoniacal holds an intermediate
place between what is divine and what is
mortal.’</p>

<p>“‘What is his power and nature?’ I inquired.&mdash;‘He
interprets and makes a communication between divine
and human things, conveying the prayers and sacrifices
of men to the Gods, and communicating the commands
and directions concerning the mode of worship most
pleasing to them, from Gods to men. He fills up that
intermediate space between these two classes of beings,
so as to bind together, by his own power, the whole
universe of things. Through him subsist all divination,
and the science of sacred things as it relates to sacrifices,
and expiations, and disenchantments, and prophecy,
and magic. The divine nature cannot immediately<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
communicate with what is human, but all that intercourse
and converse which is conceded by the Gods to men,
both whilst they sleep and when they wake, subsists
through the intervention of Love; and he who is wise
in the science of this intercourse is supremely happy,
and participates in the dæmoniacal nature; whilst he
who is wise in any other science or art, remains a mere
ordinary slave. These dæmons are, indeed, many and
various, and one of them is Love.’</p>

<p>“‘Who are the parents of Love?’ I inquired.&mdash;‘The
history of what you ask,’ replied Diotima, ‘is somewhat
long; nevertheless I will explain it to you. On the
birth of Venus the Gods celebrated a great feast, and
among them came Plenty, the son of Metis. After
supper, Poverty, observing the profusion, came to beg,
and stood beside the door. Plenty being drunk with
nectar, for wine was not yet invented, went out into
Jupiter’s garden, and fell into a deep sleep. Poverty
wishing to have a child by Plenty, on account of her
low estate, lay down by him, and from his embraces
conceived Love. Love is, therefore, the follower and
servant of Venus, because he was conceived at her birth,
and because by nature he is a lover of all that is
beautiful, and Venus was beautiful. And since Love is
the child of Poverty and Plenty, his nature and fortune
participate in that of his parents. He is for ever poor,
and so far from being delicate and beautiful, as mankind
imagine, he is squalid and withered; he flies low along
the ground, and is homeless and unsandalled; he sleeps
without covering before the doors, and in the unsheltered
streets; possessing thus far his mother’s nature, that he
is ever the companion of want. But, inasmuch as he
participates in that of his father, he is for ever scheming
to obtain things which are good and beautiful; he is
fearless, vehement, and strong; a dreadful hunter,
for ever weaving some new contrivance; exceedingly
cautious and prudent, and full of resources; he is also,<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
during his whole existence, a philosopher, a powerful
enchanter, a wizard, and a subtle sophist. And, as his
nature is neither mortal nor immortal, on the same day
when he is fortunate and successful, he will at one time
flourish, and then die away, and then, according to his
father’s nature, again revive. All that he acquires
perpetually flows away from him, so that Love is never
either rich or poor, and holding for ever an intermediate
state between ignorance and wisdom. The case stands
thus;&mdash;no God philosophises or desires to become wise,
for he is wise; nor, if there exist any other being who
is wise, does he philosophise. Nor do the ignorant
philosophise, for they desire not to become wise; for
this is the evil of ignorance, that he who has neither
intelligence, nor virtue, nor delicacy of sentiment,
imagines that he possesses all those things sufficiently.
He seeks not, therefore, that possession, of whose want
he is not aware.’&mdash;‘Who, then, O Diotima,’ I inquired,
‘are philosophers, if they are neither the ignorant nor
the wise?’&mdash;‘It is evident, even to a child, that they are
those intermediate persons, among whom is Love. For
Wisdom is one of the most beautiful of all things; Love
is that which thirsts for the beautiful, so that Love is of
necessity a philosopher, philosophy being an intermediate
state between ignorance and wisdom. His parentage
accounts for his condition, being the child of a wise and
well provided father, and of a mother both ignorant and
poor.</p>

<p>“‘Such is the dæmoniacal nature, my dear Socrates;
nor do I wonder at your error concerning Love, for you
thought, as I conjecture from what you say, that Love
was not the lover but the beloved, and thence, well concluded
that he must be supremely beautiful; for that
which is the object of Love must indeed be fair, and
delicate, and perfect, and most happy; but Love
inherits, as I have declared, a totally opposite nature.’&mdash;‘Your
words have persuasion in them, O stranger,’<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
I said; ‘be it as you say. But this Love, what advantages
does he afford to men?’&mdash;‘I will proceed to
explain it to you, Socrates. Love being such and so
produced as I have described, is, indeed, as you say,
the love of things which are beautiful. But if any one
should ask us, saying: O Socrates and Diotima, why
is Love the love of beautiful things? Or, in plainer
words, what does the lover of that which is beautiful,
love in the object of his love, and seek from it?’&mdash;‘He
seeks,’ I said, interrupting her, ‘the property and possession
of it.’&mdash;‘But that,’ she replied, ‘might still be
met with another question, What has he, who possesses
that which is beautiful?’&mdash;‘Indeed, I cannot immediately
reply.’&mdash;‘But, if changing the beautiful for good,
any one should inquire,&mdash;I ask, O Socrates, what is
that which he who loves that which is good, loves in
the object of his love?’&mdash;‘To be in his possession,’
I replied.&mdash;‘And what has he, who has the possession
of good?’&mdash;‘This question is of easier solution, he is
happy.’&mdash;‘Those who are happy, then, are happy through
the possession; and it is useless to inquire what he
desires, who desires to be happy; the question seems
to have a complete reply. But do you think that this
wish and this love are common to all men, and that all
desire that that which is good should be for ever
present to them?’&mdash;‘Certainly, common to all.’&mdash;‘Why
do we not say then, Socrates, that every one loves? if,
indeed, all love perpetually the same thing? But we
say that some love, and some do not.’&mdash;‘Indeed I
wonder why it is so.’&mdash;‘Wonder not,’ said Diotima,
‘for we select a particular species of love, and apply
to it distinctively, the appellation of that which is
universal.’&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘Give me an example of such a select application.’&mdash;‘Poetry;
which is a general name signifying every
cause whereby anything proceeds from that which is
not, into that which is; so that the exercise of every<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
inventive art is poetry, and all such artists poets. Yet
they are not called poets, but distinguished by other
names; and one portion or species of poetry, that which
has relation to music and rhythm, is divided from all
others, and known by the name belonging to all. For
this is alone properly called poetry, and those who
exercise the art of this species of poetry, poets. So
with respect to Love. Love is indeed universally all
that earnest desire for the possession of happiness and
that which is good; the greatest and the subtlest love,
and which inhabits the heart of every living being; but
those who seek this object through the acquirement of
wealth, or the exercise of the gymnastic arts, or philosophy,
are not said to love, nor are called lovers; one
species alone is called love, and those alone are said to
be lovers, and to love, who seek the attainment of the
universal desire through one species of love, which is
peculiarly distinguished by the name belonging to the
whole. It is asserted by some, that they love, who are
seeking the lost half of their divided being. But I
assert, that Love is neither the love of half nor of the
whole, unless, my friend, it meets with that which is
good; since men willingly cut off their own hands and
feet, if they think that they are the cause of evil to them.
Nor do they cherish and embrace that which may belong
to themselves, merely because it is their own; unless,
indeed, any one should choose to say, that that which is
good is attached to his own nature and is his own, whilst
that which is evil is foreign and accidental; but love
nothing but that which is good. Does it not appear so
to you?’&mdash;‘Assuredly.’&mdash;‘Can we then simply affirm
that men love that which is good?’&mdash;‘Without doubt.’&mdash;‘What,
then, must we not add, that, in addition to
loving that which is good, they love that it should be
present to themselves?’&mdash;‘Indeed that must be added.’&mdash;‘And
not merely that it should be present, but that it
should ever be present?’&mdash;‘This also must be added.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>“‘Love, then, is collectively the desire in men that
good should be for ever present to them.’&mdash;‘Most true.’&mdash;‘Since
this is the general definition of Love, can you
explain in what mode of attaining its object, and in what
species of actions, does Love peculiarly consist?’&mdash;‘If
I knew what you ask, O Diotima, I should not have
so much wondered at your wisdom, nor have sought you
out for the purpose of deriving improvement from your
instructions.’&mdash;‘I will tell you,’ she replied: ‘Love is
the desire of generation in the beautiful, both with relation
to the body and the soul.’&mdash;‘I must be a diviner
to comprehend what you say, for, being such as I am,
I confess that I do not understand it.’&mdash;‘But I will
explain it more clearly. The bodies and the souls of all
human beings are alike pregnant with their future progeny,
and when we arrive at a certain age, our nature
impels us to bring forth and propagate. This nature is
unable to produce in that which is deformed, but it can
produce in that which is beautiful. The intercourse of
the male and female in generation, a divine work,
through pregnancy and production, is, as it were, something
immortal in mortality. These things cannot take
place in that which is incongruous; for that which is
deformed is incongruous, but that which is beautiful is
congruous with what is mortal and divine. Beauty is,
therefore, the fate, and the Juno Lucina to generation.
Wherefore, whenever that which is pregnant with the
generative principle, approaches that which is beautiful,
it becomes transported with delight, and is poured forth
in overflowing pleasure, and propagates. But when it
approaches that which is deformed it is contracted by
sadness, and being repelled and checked, it does not
produce, but retains unwillingly that with which it is
pregnant. Wherefore, to one pregnant, and, as it were,
already bursting with the load of his desire, the impulse
towards that which is beautiful is intense, on account of
the great pain of retaining that which he has conceived.<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
Love, then, O Socrates, is not as you imagine the love
of the beautiful.’&mdash;‘What, then?’&mdash;‘Of generation and
production in the beautiful.’&mdash;‘Why then of generation?’&mdash;‘Generation
is something eternal and immortal
in mortality. It necessarily, from what has been confessed,
follows, that we must desire immortality together
with what is good, since Love is the desire that good be
for ever present to us. Of necessity Love must also be
the desire of immortality.’</p>

<p>“Diotima taught me all this doctrine in the discourse
we had together concerning Love; and, in addition,
she inquired, ‘What do you think, Socrates, is the
cause of this love and desire? Do you not perceive how
all animals, both those of the earth and of the air, are
affected when they desire the propagation of their species,
affected even to weakness and disease by the impulse of
their love; first, longing to be mixed with each other,
and then seeking nourishment for their offspring, so
that the feeblest are ready to contend with the strongest
in obedience to this law, and to die for the sake of their
young, or to waste away with hunger, and do or suffer
anything so that they may not want nourishment. It
might be said that human beings do these things
through reason, but can you explain why other animals
are thus affected through love?’&mdash;I confessed that I did
not know.&mdash;‘Do you imagine yourself,’ said she, ‘to be
skilful in the science of Love, if you are ignorant of
these things?’&mdash;‘As I said before, O Diotima, I come
to you, well knowing how much I am in need of a
teacher. But explain to me, I entreat you, the cause of
these things, and of the other things relating to Love.’&mdash;‘If,’
said Diotima, ‘you believe that Love is of the
same nature as we have mutually agreed upon, wonder
not that such are its effects. For the mortal nature
seeks, so far as it is able, to become deathless and
eternal. But it can only accomplish this desire by
generation, which for ever leaves another new in place<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
of the old. For, although each human being be
severally said to live, and be the same from youth to old
age, yet, that which is called the same, never contains
within itself the same things, but always is becoming
new by the loss and change of that which it possessed
before; both the hair and the flesh, and the bones, and
the entire body.</p>

<p>“‘And not only does this change take place in the
body, but also with respect to the soul. Manners,
morals, opinions, desires, pleasures, sorrows, fears;
none of these ever remain unchanged in the same
persons; but some die away, and others are produced.
And, what is yet more strange is, that not only does
some knowledge spring up, and another decay, and that
we are never the same with respect to our knowledge,
but that each several object of our thoughts suffers the
same revolution. That which is called meditation, or
the exercise of memory, is the science of the escape or
departure of memory; for, forgetfulness is the going
out of knowledge; and meditation, calling up a new
memory in the place of that which has departed, preserves
knowledge; so that, though for ever displaced
and restored, it seems to be the same. In this manner
every thing mortal is preserved: not that it is constant
and eternal, like that which is divine; but that in the
place of what has grown old and is departed, it leaves
another new like that which it was itself. By this contrivance,
O Socrates, does what is mortal, the body and
all other things, partake of immortality; that which is
immortal, is immortal in another manner. Wonder
not, then, if every thing by nature cherishes that which
was produced from itself, for this earnest Love is a
tendency towards eternity.’</p>

<p>“Having heard this discourse, I was astonished, and
asked, ‘Can these things be true, O wisest Diotima?’
And she, like an accomplished sophist, said, ‘Know
well, O Socrates, that if you only regard that love of<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
glory which inspires men, you will wonder at your own
unskilfulness in not having discovered all that I now
declare. Observe with how vehement a desire they
are affected to become illustrious and to prolong their
glory into immortal time, to attain which object, far
more ardently than for the sake of their children, all
men are ready to engage in many dangers, and expend
their fortunes, and submit to any labours and incur
any death. Do you believe that Alcestis would have
died in the place of Admetus, or Achilles for the revenge
of Patroclus, or Codrus for the kingdom of his posterity,
if they had not believed that the immortal memory
of their actions, which we now cherish, would have
remained after their death? Far otherwise; all such
deeds are done for the sake of ever-living virtue, and
this immortal glory which they have obtained; and
inasmuch as any one is of an excellent nature, so much
the more is he impelled to attain this reward. For
they love what is immortal.</p>

<p>“‘Those whose bodies alone are pregnant with this
principle of immortality are attracted by women, seeking
through the production of children what they imagine to
be happiness and immortality and an enduring remembrance;
but they whose souls are far more pregnant
than their bodies, conceive and produce that which
is more suitable to the soul. What is suitable to the
soul? Intelligence, and every other power and excellence
of the mind; of which all poets, and all other
artists who are creative and inventive, are the authors.
The greatest and most admirable wisdom is that which
regulates the government of families and states, and
which is called moderation and justice. Whosoever,
therefore, from his youth feels his soul pregnant with
the conception of these excellences, is divine; and when
due time arrives, desires to bring forth; and wandering
about, he seeks the beautiful in which he may propagate
what he has conceived; for there is no generation in<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
that which is deformed; he embraces those bodies
which are beautiful rather than those which are deformed,
in obedience to the principle which is within him, which
is ever seeking to perpetuate itself. And if he meets,
in conjunction with loveliness of form, a beautiful,
generous, and gentle soul, he embraces both at once,
and immediately undertakes to educate this object of
his love, and is inspired with an overflowing persuasion
to declare what is virtue, and what he ought to be who
would attain to its possession, and what are the duties
which it exacts. For, by the intercourse with, and as
it were, the very touch of that which is beautiful, he
brings forth and produces what he had formerly conceived;
and nourishes and educates that which is thus
produced together with the object of his love, whose
image, whether absent or present, is never divided from
his mind. So that those who are thus united are linked
by a nobler community and a firmer love, as being the
common parents of a lovelier and more endearing progeny
than the parents of other children. And every one
who considers what posterity Homer and Hesiod, and
the other great poets, have left behind them, the sources
of their own immortal memory and renown, or what
children of his soul Lycurgus has appointed to be the
guardians, not only of Lacedæmon, but of all Greece;
or what an illustrious progeny of laws Solon has produced,
and how many admirable achievements, both
among the Greeks and Barbarians, men have left as
the pledges of that love which subsisted between them
and the beautiful, would choose rather to be the parent
of such children than those in a human shape. For
divine honours have often been rendered to them on
account of such children, but on account of those in
human shape, never.</p>

<p>“‘Your own meditation, O Socrates, might perhaps
have initiated you in all these things which I have
already taught you on the subject of Love. But those<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
perfect and sublime ends to which these are only the
means, I know not that you would have been competent
to discover. I will declare them, therefore, and will
render them as intelligible as possible: do you meanwhile
strain all your attention to trace the obscure depth
of the subject. He who aspires to love rightly, ought
from his earliest youth to seek an intercourse with
beautiful forms, and first to make a single form the
object of his love, and therein to generate intellectual
excellences. He ought, then, to consider that beauty
in whatever form it resides is the brother of that beauty
which subsists in another form; and if he ought to
pursue that which is beautiful in form, it would be
absurd to imagine that beauty is not one and the same
thing in all forms, and would therefore remit much of
his ardent preference towards one, through his perception
of the multitude of claims upon his love. In
addition, he would consider the beauty which is in
souls more excellent than that which is in form. So
that one endowed with an admirable soul, even though
the flower of the form were withered, would suffice him
as the object of his love and care, and the companion
with whom he might seek and produce such conclusions
as tend to the improvement of youth; so that it might
be led to observe the beauty and the conformity which
there is in the observation of its duties and the laws,
and to esteem little the mere beauty of the outward
form. He would then conduct his pupil to science,
so that he might look upon the loveliness of wisdom;
and that contemplating thus the universal beauty, no
longer would he unworthily and meanly enslave himself
to the attractions of one form in love, nor one subject
of discipline or science, but would turn towards the
wide ocean of intellectual beauty, and from the sight
of the lovely and majestic forms which it contains,
would abundantly bring forth his conceptions in philosophy;
until, strengthened and confirmed, he should at<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
length steadily contemplate one science, which is the
science of this universal beauty.</p>

<p>“‘Attempt, I entreat you, to mark what I say with
as keen an observation as you can. He who has been
disciplined to this point in Love, by contemplating
beautiful objects gradually, and in their order, now
arriving at the end of all that concerns Love, on a
sudden beholds a beauty wonderful in its nature. This
is it, O Socrates, for the sake of which all the former
labours were endured. It is eternal, unproduced, indestructible;
neither subject to increase nor decay: not,
like other things, partly beautiful and partly deformed;
not at one time beautiful and at another time not; not
beautiful in relation to one thing and deformed in relation
to another; not here beautiful and there deformed;
not beautiful in the estimation of one person and
deformed in that of another; nor can this supreme
beauty be figured to the imagination like a beautiful
face, or beautiful hands, or any portion of the body,
nor like any discourse, nor any science. Nor does
it subsist in any other that lives or is, either in earth,
or in heaven, or in any other place; but it is eternally
uniform and consistent, and monoeidic with itself. All
other things are beautiful through a participation of it,
with this condition, that although they are subject to
production and decay, it never becomes more or less,
or endures any change. When any one, ascending
from a correct system of Love, begins to contemplate
this supreme beauty, he already touches the consummation
of his labour. For such as discipline themselves
upon this system, or are conducted by another beginning
to ascend through these transitory objects which are
beautiful, towards that which is beauty itself, proceeding
as on steps from the love of one form to that of two,
and from that of two, to that of all forms which are
beautiful; and from beautiful forms to beautiful habits
and institutions, and from institutions to beautiful doctrines;<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
until, from the meditation of many doctrines,
they arrive at that which is nothing else than the
doctrine of the supreme beauty itself, in the knowledge
and contemplation of which at length they repose.</p>

<p>“‘Such a life as this, my dear Socrates,’ exclaimed
the stranger Prophetess, ’spent in the contemplation of
the beautiful, is the life for men to live; which if you
chance ever to experience, you will esteem far beyond
gold and rich garments, and even those lovely persons
whom you and many others now gaze on with astonishment,
and are prepared neither to eat nor drink so that
you may behold and live for ever with these objects
of your love! What then shall we imagine to be the
aspect of the supreme beauty itself, simple, pure, uncontaminated
with the intermixture of human flesh and
colours, and all other idle and unreal shapes attendant
on mortality; the divine, the original, the supreme, the
monoeidic beautiful itself? What must be the life of
him who dwells with and gazes on that which it becomes
us all to seek? Think you not that to him alone is
accorded the prerogative of bringing forth, not images
and shadows of virtue, for he is in contact not with a
shadow but with reality; with virtue itself, in the production
and nourishment of which he becomes dear to
the Gods, and if such a privilege is conceded to any
human being, himself immortal.’</p>

<p>“Such, O Phædrus, and my other friends, was what
Diotima said. And being persuaded by her words, I
have since occupied myself in attempting to persuade
others, that it is not easy to find a better assistant than
Love in seeking to communicate immortality to our
human natures. Wherefore I exhort every one to honour
Love; I hold him in honour, and chiefly exercise myself
in amatory matters, and exhort others to do so; and
now and ever do I praise the power and excellence
of Love, in the best manner that I can. Let this discourse,
if it pleases you, Phædrus, be considered as an<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
encomium of Love; or call it by what other name you
will.”</p>

<p>The whole assembly praised his discourse, and
Aristophanes was on the point of making some remarks
on the allusion made by Socrates to him in a part of
his discourse, when suddenly they heard a loud knocking
at the door of the vestibule, and a clamour as of revellers,
attended by a flute-player.&mdash;“Go, boys,” said Agathon,
“and see who is there: if they are any of our friends,
call them in; if not, say that we have already done
drinking.”&mdash;A minute afterwards, they heard the voice
of Alcibiades in the vestibule excessively drunk and
roaring out:&mdash;“Where is Agathon? Lead me to
Agathon!”&mdash;The flute-player, and some of his companions
then led him in, and placed him against the
door-post, crowned with a thick crown of ivy and violets,
and having a quantity of fillets on his head.&mdash;“My
friends,” he cried out, “hail! I am excessively drunk
already, but I’ll drink with you, if you will. If not, we
will go away after having crowned Agathon, for which
purpose I came. I assure you that I could not come
yesterday, but I am now here with these fillets round my
temples, that from my own head I may crown his who,
with your leave, is the most beautiful and wisest of men.
Are you laughing at me because I am drunk? Ay, I
know what I say is true, whether you laugh or not.
But tell me at once whether I shall come in, or no.
Will you drink with me?”</p>

<p>Agathon and the whole party desired him to come in,
and recline among them; so he came in, led by his
companions. He then unbound his fillets that he might
crown Agathon, and though Socrates was just before his
eyes, he did not see him, but sat down by Agathon,
between Socrates and him, for Socrates moved out of
the way to make room for him. When he sat down, he
embraced Agathon and crowned him; and Agathon
desired the slaves to untie his sandals, that he might<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
make a third, and recline on the same couch. “By all
means,” said Alcibiades, “but what third companion
have we here?” And at the same time turning round
and seeing Socrates, he leaped up and cried out:&mdash;“O
Hercules! what have we here? You, Socrates, lying in
ambush for me wherever I go! and meeting me just as
you always do, when I least expected to see you! And,
now, what are you come here for? Why have you
chosen to recline exactly in this place, and not near
Aristophanes, or any one else who is, or wishes to be
ridiculous, but have contrived to take your place beside
the most delightful person of the whole party?”&mdash;“Agathon,”
said Socrates, “see if you cannot defend
me. I declare my friendship for this man is a bad
business: from the moment that I first began to know
him I have never been permitted to converse with, or
so much as look upon any one else. If I do, he is so
jealous and suspicious that he does the most extravagant
things, and hardly refrains from beating me. I entreat
you to prevent him from doing anything of that kind at
present. Procure a reconciliation: or, if he perseveres
in attempting any violence, I entreat you to defend me.”&mdash;“Indeed,”
said Alcibiades, “I will not be reconciled
to you; I shall find another opportunity to punish you
for this. But now,” said he, addressing Agathon, “lend
me some of those fillets, that I may crown the wonderful
head of this fellow, lest I incur the blame, that having
crowned you, I neglected to crown him who conquers
all men with his discourses, not yesterday alone as you
did, but ever.”</p>

<p>Saying this he took the fillets, and having bound the
head of Socrates, and again having reclined, said:
“Come, my friends, you seem to be sober enough.
You must not flinch, but drink, for that was your agreement
with me before I came in. I choose as president,
until you have drunk enough&mdash;myself. Come, Agathon,
if you have got a great goblet, fetch it out. But no<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
matter, that wine-cooler will do; bring it, boy!” And
observing that it held more than eight cups, he first
drank it off, and then ordered it to be filled for Socrates,
and said:&mdash;“Observe, my friends, I cannot invent any
scheme against Socrates, for he will drink as much as
any one desires him, and not be in the least drunk.”
Socrates, after the boy had filled up, drank it off; and
Eryximachus said:&mdash;“Shall we then have no conversation
or singing over our cups, but drink down stupidly,
just as if we were thirsty?” And Alcibiades said:
“Ah, Eryximachus, I did not see you before; hail, you
excellent son of a wise and excellent father!”&mdash;“Hail
to you also,” replied Eryximachus, “but what shall we
do?”&mdash;“Whatever you command, for we ought to submit
to your directions; a physician is worth a hundred
common men. Command us as you please.”&mdash;“Listen
then,” said Eryximachus, “before you came in, each of
us had agreed to deliver as eloquent a discourse as he
could in praise of Love, beginning at the right hand;
all the rest of us have fulfilled our engagement; you
have not spoken, and yet have drunk with us: you
ought to bear your part in the discussion; and having
done so, command what you please to Socrates, who
shall have the privilege of doing so to his right-hand
neighbour, and so on to the others.”&mdash;“Indeed, there
appears some justice in your proposal, Eryximachus,
though it is rather unfair to induce a drunken man to
set his discourse in competition with that of those who
are sober. And, besides, did Socrates really persuade
you that what he just said about me was true, or do
you not know that matters are in fact exactly the reverse
of his representation? For I seriously believe that,
should I praise in his presence, be he god or man, any
other beside himself, he would not keep his hands off
me. But I assure you, Socrates, I will praise no one
beside yourself in your presence.”</p>

<p>“Do so, then,” said Eryximachus, “praise Socrates<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
if you please.”&mdash;“What,” said Alcibiades, “shall I
attack him, and punish him before you all?”&mdash;“What
have you got into your head now,” said Socrates, “are
you going to expose me to ridicule, and to misrepresent
me? Or what are you going to do?”&mdash;“I will only
speak the truth; will you permit me on this condition?”&mdash;“I
not only permit, but exhort you to say all the truth
you know,” replied Socrates. “I obey you willingly,”
said Alcibiades, “and if I advance anything untrue, do
you, if you please, interrupt me, and convict me of misrepresentation,
for I would never willingly speak falsely.
And bear with me if I do not relate things in their order,
but just as I remember them, for it is not easy for a
man in my present condition to enumerate systematically
all your singularities.</p>

<p>“I will begin the praise of Socrates by comparing
him to a certain statue. Perhaps he will think that
this statue is introduced for the sake of ridicule, but I
assure you that it is necessary for the illustration of
truth. I assert, then, that Socrates is exactly like those
Silenuses that sit in the sculptors’ shops, and which are
carved holding flutes or pipes, but which, when divided
in two, are found to contain withinside the images of
the gods. I assert that Socrates is like the satyr
Marsyas. That your form and appearance are like
these satyrs’, I think that even you will not venture to
deny; and how like you are to them in all other things,
now hear. Are you not scornful and petulant? If you
deny this, I will bring witnesses. Are you not a piper,
and far more wonderful a one than he? For Marsyas,
and whoever now pipes the music that he taught, for
that music which is of heaven, and described as being
taught by Marsyas, enchants men through the power of
the mouth. For if any musician, be he skilful or not,
awakens this music, it alone enables him to retain the
minds of men, and from the divinity of its nature makes
evident those who are in want of the gods and initiation.<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
You differ only from Marsyas in this circumstance, that
you effect without instruments, by mere words, all that
he can do. For when we hear Pericles, or any other
accomplished orator, deliver a discourse, no one, as it
were, cares any thing about it. But when any one hears
you, or even your words related by another, though ever
so rude and unskilful a speaker, be that person a woman,
man or child, we are struck and retained, as it were, by
the discourse clinging to our mind.</p>

<p>“If I was not afraid that I am a great deal too
drunk, I would confirm to you by an oath the strange
effects which I assure you I have suffered from his
words, and suffer still; for when I hear him speak, my
heart leaps up far more than the hearts of those who
celebrate the Corybantic mysteries; my tears are poured
out as he talks, a thing I have seen happen to many
others beside myself. I have heard Pericles and other
excellent orators, and have been pleased with their
discourses, but I suffered nothing of this kind; nor
was my soul ever on those occasions disturbed and filled
with self-reproach, as if it were slavishly laid prostrate.
But this Marsyas here has often affected me in the way
I describe, until the life which I lead seemed hardly
worth living. Do not deny it, Socrates, for I well know
that if even now I chose to listen to you, I could not
resist, but should again suffer the same effects. For,
my friends, he forces me to confess that while I myself
am still in want of many things, I neglect my own necessities,
and attend to those of the Athenians. I stop my
ears, therefore, as from the Syrens, and flee away as
fast as possible, that I may not sit down beside him
and grow old in listening to his talk. For this man
has reduced me to feel the sentiment of shame, which
I imagine no one would readily believe was in me; he
alone inspires me with remorse and awe. For I feel
in his presence my incapacity of refuting what he says,
or of refusing to do that which he directs; but when I<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
depart from him, the glory which the multitude confers
overwhelms me. I escape, therefore, and hide myself
from him, and when I see him I am overwhelmed with
humiliation, because I have neglected to do what I have
confessed to him ought to be done; and often and often
have I wished that he were no longer to be seen among
men. But if that were to happen, I well know that I
should suffer far greater pain; so that where I can turn,
or what I can do with this man, I know not. All this
have I and many others suffered from the pipings of
this satyr.</p>

<p>“And observe, how like he is to what I said, and
what a wonderful power he possesses. Know that there
is not one of you who is aware of the real nature of
Socrates; but since I have begun, I will make him plain
to you. You observe how passionately Socrates affects
the intimacy of those who are beautiful, and how ignorant
he professes himself to be; appearances in themselves
excessively Silenic. This, my friends, is the external
form with which, like one of the sculptured Sileni, he
has clothed himself; for if you open him, you will find
within admirable temperance and wisdom. For he cares
not for mere beauty, but despises more than any one
can imagine all external possessions, whether it be
beauty or wealth, or glory, or any other thing for which
the multitude felicitates the possessor. He esteems
these things and us who honour them, as nothing, and
lives among men, making all the objects of their admiration
the playthings of his irony. But I know not if any
one of you have ever seen the divine images which are
within, when he has been opened and is serious. I
have seen them, and they are so supremely beautiful, so
golden, so divine, and wonderful, that everything which
Socrates commands surely ought to be obeyed, even like
the voice of a God.</p>

<p>“At one time we were fellow-soldiers, and had our
mess together in the camp before Potidæa. Socrates<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
there overcame not only me, but every one beside, in
endurance of toils: when, as often happens in a campaign,
we were reduced to few provisions, there were
none who could sustain hunger like Socrates; and when
we had plenty, he alone seemed to enjoy our military
fare. He never drank much willingly, but when he was
compelled he conquered all even in that to which he
was least accustomed; and what is most astonishing,
no person ever saw Socrates drunk either then or at
any other time. In the depth of winter (and the
winters there are excessively rigid,) he sustained calmly
incredible hardships; and amongst other things, whilst
the frost was intolerably severe, and no one went out of
their tents, or if they went out, wrapt themselves up
carefully, and put fleeces under their feet, and bound
their legs with hairy skins, Socrates went out only with
the same cloak on that he usually wore, and walked
barefoot upon the ice; more easily, indeed, than those
who had sandalled themselves so delicately: so that the
soldiers thought that he did it to mock their want of
fortitude. It would indeed be worth while to commemorate
all that this brave man did and endured in
that expedition. In one instance he was seen early in
the morning, standing in one place wrapt in meditation;
and as he seemed not to be able to unravel the subject
of his thoughts, he still continued to stand as inquiring
and discussing within himself, and when noon came, the
soldiers observed him, and said to one another&mdash;‘Socrates
has been standing there thinking, ever since the morning.’
At last some Ionians came to the spot, and having
supped, as it was summer, bringing their blankets, they
lay down to sleep in the cool; they observed that
Socrates continued to stand there the whole night until
morning, and that, when the sun rose, he saluted it with
a prayer and departed.</p>

<p>“I ought not to omit what Socrates is in battle. For
in that battle after which the generals decreed to me<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
the prize of courage, Socrates alone of all men was the
saviour of my life, standing by me when I had fallen
and was wounded, and preserving both myself and my
arms from the hands of the enemy. On that occasion
I entreated the generals to decree the prize, as it was
most due, to him. And this, O Socrates, you cannot
deny, that the generals wishing to conciliate a person of
my rank, desired to give me the prize, you were far more
earnestly desirous than the generals that this glory should
be attributed not to yourself, but me.</p>

<p>“But to see Socrates when our army was defeated
and scattered in flight at Delius, was a spectacle worthy
to behold. On that occasion I was among the cavalry,
and he on foot, heavily armed. After the total rout of
our troops, he and Laches retreated together; I came
up by chance, and seeing them, bade them be of good
cheer, for that I would not leave them. As I was on
horseback, and therefore less occupied by a regard of my
own situation, I could better observe than at Potidæa
the beautiful spectacle exhibited by Socrates on this
emergency. How superior was he to Laches in presence
of mind and courage! Your representation of him on
the stage, O Aristophanes, was not wholly unlike his
real self on this occasion, for he walked and darted his
regards around with a majestic composure, looking
tranquilly both on his friends and enemies; so that it
was evident to every one, even from afar, that whoever
should venture to attack him would encounter a desperate
resistance. He and his companion thus departed in
safety; for those who are scattered in flight are pursued
and killed, whilst men hesitate to touch those who
exhibit such a countenance as that of Socrates even
in defeat.</p>

<p>“Many other and most wonderful qualities might well
be praised in Socrates; but such as these might singly
be attributed to others. But that which is unparalleled
in Socrates, is, that he is unlike, and above comparison,<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
with all other men, whether those who have lived in
ancient times, or those who exist now. For it may be
conjectured, that Brasidas and many others are such as
was Achilles. Pericles deserves comparison with Nestor
and Antenor; and other excellent persons of various
times may, with probability, be drawn into comparison
with each other. But to such a singular man as this,
both himself and his discourses are so uncommon, no
one, should he seek, would find a parallel among the
present or the past generations of mankind; unless they
should say that he resembled those with whom I lately
compared him, for, assuredly, he and his discourses are
like nothing but the Silen and the Satyrs. At first I
forgot to make you observe how like his discourses are
to those Satyrs when they are opened, for, if any one
will listen to the talk of Socrates, it will appear to him
at first extremely ridiculous; the phrases and expressions
which he employs, fold around his exterior the skin, as
it were, of a rude and wanton Satyr. He is always
talking about great market-asses, and brass-founders,
and leather-cutters, and skin-dressers; and this is his
perpetual custom, so that any dull and unobservant
person might easily laugh at his discourse. But if any
one should see it opened, as it were, and get within the
sense of his words, he would then find that they alone
of all that enters into the mind of man to utter, had a
profound and persuasive meaning, and that they were
most divine; and that they presented to the mind
innumerable images of every excellence, and that they
tended towards objects of the highest moment, or rather
towards all that he who seeks the possession of what is
supremely beautiful and good need regard as essential
to the accomplishment of his ambition.</p>

<p>“These are the things, my friends, for which I praise
Socrates.”</p>

<p>Alcibiades having said this, the whole party burst
into a laugh at his frankness, and Socrates said, “You<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
seem to be sober enough, Alcibiades, else you would
not have made such a circuit of words, only to hide the
main design for which you made this long speech, and
which, as it were carelessly, you just throw in at the
last; now, as if you had not said all this for the mere
purpose of dividing me and Agathon? You think that
I ought to be your friend, and to care for no one else.
I have found you out; it is evident enough for what
design you invented all this Satyrical and Silenic drama.
But, my dear Agathon, do not let his device succeed.
I entreat you to permit no one to throw discord between
us.”&mdash;“No doubt,” said Agathon, “he sat down between
us only that he might divide us; but this shall
not assist his scheme, for I will come and sit near you.”&mdash;“Do
so,” said Socrates, “come, there is room for
you by me.”&mdash;“Oh, Jupiter!” exclaimed Alcibiades,
“what I endure from that man! He thinks to subdue
every way; but, at least, I pray you, let Agathon remain
between us.”&mdash;“Impossible,” said Socrates, “you have
just praised me; I ought to praise him sitting at my
right hand. If Agathon is placed beside you, will he
not praise me before I praise him? Now, my dear
friend, allow the young man to receive what praise I
can give him. I have a great desire to pronounce his
encomium.”&mdash;“Quick, quick, Alcibiades,” said Agathon,
“I cannot stay here, I must change my place, or
Socrates will not praise me.”&mdash;Agathon then arose to
take his place near Socrates.</p>

<p>He had no sooner reclined than there came in a
number of revellers&mdash;for some one who had gone out
had left the door open&mdash;and took their places on the
vacant couches, and everything became full of confusion;
and no order being observed, every one was obliged to
drink a great quantity of wine. Eryximachus, and
Phædrus, and some others, said Aristodemus, went
home to bed; that, for his part, he went to sleep on
his couch, and slept long and soundly&mdash;the nights<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
were then long&mdash;until the cock crew in the morning.
When he awoke he found that some were still fast
asleep, and others had gone home, and that Aristophanes,
Agathon, and Socrates had alone stood it
out, and were still drinking out of a great goblet which
they passed round and round. Socrates was disputing
between them. The beginning of their discussion
Aristodemus said that he did not recollect, because he
was asleep; but it was terminated by Socrates forcing
them to confess, that the same person is able to compose
both tragedy and comedy, and that the foundations of
the tragic and comic arts were essentially the same.
They, rather convicted than convinced, went to sleep.
Aristophanes first awoke, and then, it being broad daylight,
Agathon. Socrates, having put them to sleep,
went away, Aristodemus following him, and coming to
the Lyceum he washed himself, as he would have done
anywhere else, and after having spent the day there in
his accustomed manner, went home in the evening.</p>

<small>OR, OF THE ILIAD.</small></h2>

<p class="h2sub fantasy">Translated from Plato.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Socrates</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Ion</span>.</h3>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Hail to thee, O Ion! from whence
returnest thou amongst us now?&mdash;from
thine own native Ephesus?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> No, Socrates; I come from Epidaurus and the
feasts in honour of Æsculapius.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Had the Epidaurians instituted a contest of
rhapsody in honour of the God?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> And not in rhapsodies alone; there were contests
in every species of music.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> And in which did you contend? And what
was the success of your efforts?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> I bore away the first prize at the games, O
Socrates.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Well done! You have now only to consider
how you shall win the Panathenæa.</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> That may also happen, God willing.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Your profession, O Ion, has often appeared
to me an enviable one. For, together with the nicest
care of your person, and the most studied elegance of
dress, it imposes upon you the necessity of a familiar<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
acquaintance with many and excellent poets, and
especially with Homer, the most admirable of them all.
Nor is it merely because you can repeat the verses
of this great poet, that I envy you, but because you
fathom his inmost thoughts. For he is no rhapsodist
who does not understand the whole scope and intention
of the poet, and is not capable of interpreting it to his
audience. This he cannot do without a full comprehension
of the meaning of the author he undertakes to
illustrate; and worthy, indeed, of envy are those who
can fulfil these conditions.</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Thou speakest truth, O Socrates. And, indeed,
I have expended my study particularly on this part
of my profession. I flatter myself that no man living
excels me in the interpretation of Homer; neither
Metrodorus of Lampsacus, nor Stesimbrotus the Thasian,
nor Glauco, nor any other rhapsodist of the present
times can express so many various and beautiful
thoughts upon Homer as I can.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> I am persuaded of your eminent skill,
O Ion. You will not, I hope, refuse me a specimen
of it?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> And, indeed, it would be worth your while to
hear me declaim upon Homer. I deserve a golden
crown from his admirers.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> And I will find leisure some day or other
to request you to favour me so far. At present, I will
only trouble you with one question. Do you excel in
explaining Homer alone, or are you conscious of a
similar power with regard to Hesiod and Archilochus?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> I possess this high degree of skill with regard
to Homer alone, and I consider that sufficient.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Are there any subjects upon which Homer
and Hesiod say the same things?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Many, as it seems to me.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Whether do you demonstrate these things
better in Homer or Hesiod?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> In the same manner, doubtless; inasmuch as
they say the same words with regard to the same
things.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> But with regard to those things in which
they differ;&mdash;Homer and Hesiod both treat of divination,
do they not?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Certainly.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Do you think that you or a diviner would
make the best exposition, respecting all that these poets
say of divination, both as they agree and as they differ?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> A diviner probably.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Suppose you were a diviner, do you not
think that you could explain the discrepancies of those
poets on the subject of your profession, if you understand
their agreement?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Clearly so.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> How does it happen then that you are
possessed of skill to illustrate Homer, and not Hesiod,
or any other poet in an equal degree? Is the subject-matter
of the poetry of Homer different from all other
poets’? Does he not principally treat of war and social
intercourse, and of the distinct functions and characters
of the brave man and the coward, the professional and
private person, the mutual relations which subsist
between the Gods and men; together with the modes
of their intercourse, the phænomena of Heaven, the
secrets of Hades, and the origin of Gods and heroes?
Are not these the materials from which Homer wrought
his poem?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Assuredly, O Socrates.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> And the other poets, do they not treat of
the same matter?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Certainly: but not like Homer.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> How! Worse?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Oh! far worse.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Then Homer treats of them better than
they?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Oh! Jupiter!&mdash;how much better!</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Amongst a number of persons employed in
solving a problem of arithmetic, might not a person
know, my dear Ion, which had given the right answer?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Certainly.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> The same person who had been aware of
the false one, or some other?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> The same, clearly.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> That is, some one who understood arithmetic?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Certainly.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Among a number of persons giving their
opinions on the wholesomeness of different foods,
whether would one person be capable to pronounce
upon the rectitude of the opinions of those who judged
rightly, and another on the erroneousness of those which
were incorrect, or would the same person be competent
to decide respecting them both?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> The same, evidently.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> What would you call that person?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> A physician.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> We may assert then, universally, that the
same person who is competent to determine the truth,
is competent also to determine the falsehood of whatever
assertion is advanced on the same subject; and, it is
manifest, that he who cannot judge respecting the falsehood,
or unfitness of what is said upon a given subject,
is equally incompetent to determine upon its truth or
beauty?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Assuredly.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> The same person would then be competent
or incompetent for both?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Do you not say that Homer and the other
poets, and among them Hesiod and Archilochus, speak
of the same things, but unequally; one better and the
other worse?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> And I speak truth.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> But if you can judge of what is well said
by the one, you must also be able to judge of what is ill
said by another, inasmuch as it expresses less correctly.</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> It should seem so.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Then, my dear friend, we should not err if
we asserted that Ion possessed a like power of illustration
respecting Homer and all other poets; especially
since he confesses that the same person must be esteemed
a competent judge of all those who speak on the same
subjects; inasmuch as those subjects are understood by
him when spoken of by one, and the subject-matter of
almost all the poets is the same.</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> What can be the reason then, O Socrates, that
when any other poet is the subject of conversation I
cannot compel my attention, and I feel utterly unable
to declaim anything worth talking of, and positively go
to sleep? But when any one makes mention of Homer,
my mind applies itself without effort to the subject;
I awaken as if it were from a trance, and a profusion of
eloquent expressions suggest themselves involuntarily?</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> It is not difficult to suggest the cause of
this, my dear friend. You are evidently unable to declaim
on Homer according to art and knowledge; for
did your art endow you with this faculty, you would be
equally capable of exerting it with regard to any other
of the poets. Is not poetry, as an art or a faculty, a
thing entire and one?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Assuredly.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> The same mode of consideration must be
admitted with respect to all arts which are severally one
and entire. Do you desire to hear what I understand
by this, O Ion?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Yes, by Jupiter, Socrates, I am delighted with
listening to you wise men.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> It is you who are wise, my dear Ion; you
rhapsodists, actors, and the authors of the poems you<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
recite. I, like an unprofessional and private man, can
only speak the truth. Observe how common, vulgar,
and level to the comprehension of any one, is the question
which I now ask relative to the same consideration belonging
to one entire art. Is not painting an art whole
and entire?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Certainly.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Did you ever know a person competent to
judge of the paintings of Polygnotus, the son of Aglaophon,
and incompetent to judge of the production of
any other painter; who, on the supposition of the works
of other painters being exhibited to him, was wholly at
a loss, and very much inclined to go to sleep, and lost
all faculty of reasoning on the subject; but when his
opinion was required of Polygnotus, or any one single
painter you please, awoke, paid attention to the subject,
and discoursed on it with great eloquence and sagacity?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Never, by Jupiter!</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Did you ever know any one very skilful in
determining the merits of Dædalus, the son of Metion,
Epius, the son of Panopus, Theodorus the Samian, or
any other great sculptor, who was immediately at a loss,
and felt sleepy the moment any other sculptor was
mentioned?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> I never met with such a person certainly.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Nor, do I think, that you ever met with a
man professing himself a judge of poetry and rhapsody,
and competent to criticise either Olympus, Thamyris,
Orpheus, or Phemius of Ithaca, the rhapsodist, who,
the moment he came to Ion the Ephesian, felt himself
quite at a loss, and utterly incompetent to judge whether
he rhapsodised well or ill.</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> I cannot refute you, Socrates, but of this I am
conscious to myself: that I excel all men in the copiousness
and beauty of my illustrations of Homer, as all
who have heard me will confess, and with respect to
other poets, I am deserted of this power. It is for<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
you to consider what may be the cause of this distinction.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> I will tell you, O Ion, what appears to me
to be the cause of this inequality of power. It is that
you are not master of any art for the illustration of
Homer, but it is a divine influence which moves you,
like that which resides in the stone called magnet by
Euripides, and Heraclea by the people. For not only
does this stone possess the power of attracting iron
rings, but it can communicate to them the power of
attracting other rings; so that you may see sometimes
a long chain of rings, and other iron substances, attached
and suspended one to the other by this influence. And
as the power of the stone circulates through all the links
of this series, and attaches each to each, so the Muse,
communicating through those whom she has first inspired,
to all others capable of sharing in the inspiration,
the influence of that first enthusiasm, creates a chain
and a succession. For the authors of those great poems
which we admire, do not attain to excellence through
the rules of any art, but they utter their beautiful
melodies of verse in a state of inspiration, and, as it
were, <i>possessed</i> by a spirit not their own. Thus the
composers of lyrical poetry create those admired songs
of theirs in a state of divine insanity, like the Corybantes,
who lose all control over their reason in the
enthusiasm of the sacred dance; and, during this
supernatural possession, are excited to the rhythm
and harmony which they communicate to men. Like
the Bacchantes, who, when possessed by the God, draw
honey and milk from the rivers, in which, when they
come to their senses, they find nothing but simple water.
For the souls of the poets, as poets tell us, have this
peculiar ministration in the world. They tell us that
these souls, flying like bees from flower to flower, and
wandering over the gardens and the meadows, and the
honey-flowing fountains of the Muses, return to us laden<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
with the sweetness of melody; and arrayed as they are
in the plumes of rapid imagination, they speak truth.
For a Poet is indeed a thing ethereally light, winged,
and sacred, nor can he compose anything worth calling
poetry until he becomes inspired, and, as it were, mad,
or whilst any reason remains in him. For whilst a man
retains any portion of the thing called reason, he is
utterly incompetent to produce poetry or to vaticinate.
Thus, those who declaim various and beautiful poetry
upon any subject, as for instance upon Homer, are not
enabled to do so by art or study; but every rhapsodist
or poet, whether dithyrambic, encomiastic, choral, epic,
or iambic, is excellent in proportion to the extent of his
participation in the divine influence, and the degree in
which the Muse itself has descended on him. In other
respects, poets may be sufficiently ignorant and incapable.
For they do not compose according to any art
which they have acquired, but from the impulse of the
divinity within them; for did they know any rules of
criticism according to which they could compose beautiful
verses upon one subject, they would be able to exert
the same faculty with respect to all or any other. The
God seems purposely to have deprived all poets, prophets,
and soothsayers of every particle of reason and understanding,
the better to adapt them to their employment
as his ministers and interpreters; and that we, their
auditors, may acknowledge that those who write so
beautifully, are possessed, and address us, inspired by
the God. Tynnicus the Chalcidean, is a manifest
proof of this, for he never before composed any poem
worthy to be remembered; and yet, was the author of
that Pæan which everybody sings, and which excels
almost every other hymn, and which he himself acknowledges
to have been inspired by the Muse. And, thus,
it appears to me that the God proves beyond a doubt,
that these transcendent poems are not human as the
work of men, but divine as coming from the God. Poets
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
then are the interpreters of the divinities&mdash;each being
possessed by some one deity; and to make this apparent,
the God designedly inspires the worst poets with the
sublimest verse. Does it seem to you that I am in the
right, O Ion?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Yes, by Jupiter! My mind is enlightened by
your words, O Socrates, and it appears to me that great
poets interpret to us through some divine election of
the God.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> And do not you rhapsodists interpret poets?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> We do.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Thus you interpret the interpreters?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Evidently.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Remember this, and tell me; and do not
conceal that which I ask. When you declaim well, and
strike your audience with admiration; whether you sing
of Ulysses rushing upon the threshold of his palace,
discovering himself to the suitors, and pouring his shafts
out at his feet; or of Achilles assailing Hector; or those
affecting passages concerning Andromache, or Hecuba,
or Priam, are you then self-possessed? or, rather, are
you not rapt and filled with such enthusiasm by the
deeds you recite, that you fancy yourself in Ithaca or
Troy, or wherever else the poem transports you?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> You speak most truly, Socrates, nor will I deny
it; for, when I recite of sorrow my eyes fill with tears;
and, when of fearful or terrible deeds, my hair stands on
end, and my heart beats fast.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Tell me, Ion, can we call him in his senses,
who weeps while dressed in splendid garments, and
crowned with a golden coronal, not losing any of these
things? and is filled with fear when surrounded by ten
thousand friendly persons, not one among whom desires
to despoil or injure him?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> To say the truth, we could not.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Do you often perceive your audience moved
also?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Many among them, and frequently. I, standing
on the rostrum, see them weeping, with eyes fixed
earnestly on me, and overcome by my declamation. I
have need so to agitate them; for if they weep, I laugh,
taking their money; if they should laugh, I must weep,
going without it.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Do you not perceive that your auditor is the
last link of that chain which I have described as held
together through the power of the magnet? You
rhapsodists and actors are the middle links, of which
the poet is the first&mdash;and through all these the God
influences whichever mind he selects, as they conduct
this power one to the other; and thus, as rings from
the stone, so hangs a long series of chorus-dancers,
teachers, and disciples from the Muse. Some poets are
influenced by one Muse, some by another; we call them
possessed, and this word really expresses the truth, for
they are held. Others, who are interpreters, are inspired
by the first links, the poets, and are filled with enthusiasm,
some by one, some by another; some by Orpheus,
some by Musæus, but the greater number are possessed
and inspired by Homer. You, O Ion, are influenced by
Homer. If you recite the works of any other poet, you
get drowsy, and are at a loss what to say; but when
you hear any of the compositions of that poet you are
roused, your thoughts are excited, and you grow
eloquent;&mdash;for what you say of Homer is not derived
from any art or knowledge, but from divine inspiration
and possession. As the Corybantes feel acutely the
melodies of him by whom they are inspired, and abound
with verse and gesture for his songs alone, and care for
no other; thus, you, O Ion, are eloquent when you
expound Homer, and are barren of words with regard
to every other poet. And this explains the question you
asked, wherefore Homer, and no other poet, inspires you
with eloquence. It is that you are thus excellent in your
praise, not through science but from divine inspiration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> You say the truth, Socrates. Yet, I am surprised
that you should be able to persuade me that I am
possessed and insane when I praise Homer. I think I
shall not appear such to you when you hear me.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> I desire to hear you, but not before you
have answered me this one question. What subject
does Homer treat best? for, surely, he does not treat all
equally.</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> You are aware that he treats of every thing.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Does Homer mention subjects on which you
are ignorant?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> What can those be?</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Does not Homer frequently dilate on various
arts&mdash;on chariot-driving, for instance? if I remember
the verses I will repeat them.</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> I will repeat them, for I remember them.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Repeat what Nestor says to his son Antilochus,
counselling him to be cautious in turning, during
the chariot-race at the funeral games of Patroclus.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Enough. Now, O Ion, would a physician
or a charioteer be the better judge as to Homer’s sagacity
on this subject?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Of course, a charioteer.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Because he understands the art&mdash;or from
what other reason?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> From his knowledge of the art.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> For one science is not gifted with the power
of judging of another&mdash;a steersman, for instance, does
not understand medicine?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Without doubt.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Nor a physician, architecture?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Of course not.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Is it not thus with every art? If we are
adepts in one, we are ignorant of another. But first,
tell me, do not all arts differ one from the other?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> They do.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> For you, as well as I, can testify that when
we say an art is the knowledge of one thing, we do not
mean that it is the knowledge of another.</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Certainly.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> For, if each art contained the knowledge
of all things, why should we call them by different
names? we do so that we may distinguish them one
from the other. Thus, you as well as I, know that
these are five fingers; and if I asked you whether we
both meant the same thing or another, when we speak
of arithmetic&mdash;would you not say the same?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> And tell me, when we learn one art we
must both learn the same things with regard to it; and
other things if we learn another?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Certainly.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> And he who is not versed in an art, is not
a good judge of what is said or done with respect to it?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Certainly not.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> To return to the verses which you just
recited, do you think that you or a charioteer would be
better capable of deciding whether Homer had spoken
rightly or not?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Doubtless a charioteer.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> For you are a rhapsodist, and not a
charioteer?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> And the art of reciting verses is different
from that of driving chariots?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> And if it is different, it supposes a knowledge
of different things?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Certainly.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> And when Homer introduces Hecamede,
the concubine of Nestor, giving Machaon a posset to
drink, and he speaks thus:&mdash;</p>

make some such demand as this to me:&mdash;Come,

description of these arts, assist me also in the inquiry
as to his competence on the subject of soothsayers and
divination; and how far he speaks well or ill on such

<p>I assert, it belongs to a soothsayer both to observe and

<p><i>Ion.</i> And you assert the truth, O Socrates.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> And you also, my dear Ion. For we have
in our turn recited from the Odyssey and the Iliad,
passages relating to vaticination, to medicine and the
piscatorial art; and as you are more skilled in Homer
than I can be, do you now make mention of whatever
relates to the rhapsodist and his art; for a rhapsodist
is competent above all other men to consider and pronounce
on whatever has relation to his art.</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Or with respect to everything else mentioned
by Homer.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Do not be so forgetful as to say everything.
A good memory is particularly necessary for a
rhapsodist.</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> And what do I forget?</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Do you not remember that you admitted<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
the art of reciting verses was different from that of
driving chariots?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> I remember.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> And did you not admit that being different,
the subjects of its knowledge must also be different?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Certainly.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> You will not assert that the art of rhapsody
is that of universal knowledge; a rhapsodist may
be ignorant of some things.</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Except, perhaps, such things as we now discuss,
O Socrates.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> What do you mean by <i>such</i> subjects, besides
those which relate to other arts? And with which
among them do you profess a competent acquaintance,
since not with all?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> I imagine that the rhapsodist has a perfect
knowledge of what it is becoming for a man to
speak&mdash;what for a woman; what for a slave, what
for a free man; what for the ruler, what for him who is
governed.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> How! do you think that a rhapsodist
knows better than a pilot what the captain of a ship in
a tempest ought to say?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> In such a circumstance I allow that the pilot
would know best.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Has the rhapsodist or the physician the
clearest knowledge of what ought to be said to a sick
man?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> In that case the physician.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> But you assert that he knows what a slave
ought to say?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Certainly.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> To take for example, in the driving of
cattle; a rhapsodist would know much better than the
herdsman what ought to be said to a slave engaged in
bringing back a herd of oxen run wild?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> No, indeed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> But what a woman should say concerning
spinning wool?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Of course not.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> He would know, however, what a man,
who is a general, should say when exhorting his troops?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Yes; a rhapsodist would know that.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> How! is rhapsody and strategy the same
art?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> I know what it is fitting for a general to say.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Probably because you are learned in war,
O Ion. For if you are equally expert in horsemanship
and playing on the harp, you would know whether a
man rode well or ill. But if I should ask you which
understands riding best, a horseman or a harper, what
would you answer?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> A horseman, of course.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> And if you knew a good player on the harp,
you would in the same way say that he understood harp-playing
and not riding?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Certainly.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Since you understand strategy, you can
tell me which is the most excellent, the art of war or
rhapsody?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> One does not appear to me to excel the other.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> One is not better than the other, say you?
Do you say that tactics and rhapsody are two arts or
one?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> They appear to me to be the same.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Then a good rhapsodist is also a good
general.</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Of course.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> And a good general is a good rhapsodist?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> I do not say that.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> You said that a good rhapsodist was also
a good general.</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> I did.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Are you not the best rhapsodist in Greece?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> By far, O Socrates.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> And you are also the most excellent general
among the Greeks?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> I am. I learned the art from Homer.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> How is it then, by Jupiter, that being both
the best general and the best rhapsodist among us,
you continually go about Greece rhapsodising, and never
lead our armies? Does it seem to you that the Greeks
greatly need golden-crowned rhapsodists, and have no
want of generals?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> My native town, O Socrates, is ruled by yours,
and requires no general for her wars;&mdash;and neither will
your city nor the Lacedemonians elect me to lead their
armies&mdash;you think your own generals sufficient.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> My good Ion, are you acquainted with
Apollodorus the Cyzicenian?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> Who do you mean?</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> He whom, though a stranger, the Athenians
often elected general; and Phanosthenes the Andrian,
and Heraclides the Clazomenian, all foreigners, but whom
this city has chosen, as being great men, to lead its
armies, and to fill other high offices. Would not, therefore,
Ion the Ephesian be elected and honoured if he
were esteemed capable? Were not the Ephesians
originally from Athens, and is Ephesus the least of
cities? But if you spoke true, Ion, and praise Homer
according to art and knowledge, you have deceived me,&mdash;since
you declared that you were learned on the subject
of Homer, and would communicate your knowledge to
me&mdash;but you have disappointed me, and are far from
keeping your word. For you will not explain in what
you are so excessively clever, though I greatly desire to
learn; but, as various as Proteus, you change from one
thing to another, and to escape at last, you disappear in
the form of a general, without disclosing your Homeric
wisdom. If, therefore, you possess the learning which
you promised to expound on the subject of Homer, you<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
deceive me and are false. But if you are eloquent on
the subject of this Poet, not through knowledge, but by
inspiration, being possessed by him, ignorant the while
of the wisdom and beauty you display, then I allow that
you are no deceiver. Choose then whether you will be
considered false or inspired?</p>

<p><i>Ion.</i> It is far better, O Socrates, to be thought
inspired.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> It is better both for you and for us, O Ion,
to say that you are the inspired, and not the learned,
eulogist of Homer.</p>

THE FUNERAL ORATION.</small></h2>

<p class="h2sub fantasy">A Fragment.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Socrates</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Menexenus</span>.</h3>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Whence comest thou, O Menexenus?
from the forum?</p>

<p><i>Menexenus.</i> Even so; and from
the senate-house.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> What was thy business with the senate?
Art thou persuaded that thou hast attained to that
perfection of discipline and philosophy, from which thou
mayest aspire to undertake greater matters? Wouldst
thou, at thine age, my wonderful friend, assume to thyself
the government of us who are thine elders, lest thy
family should at any time fail in affording us a protector?</p>

<p><i>Menexenus.</i> Thou, O Socrates, shouldst permit and
counsel me to enter into public life. I would earnestly
endeavour to fit myself for the attempt. If otherwise, I
would abstain. On the present occasion, I went to the
senate-house, merely from having heard that the senate
was about to elect one to speak concerning those who<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
are dead. Thou knowest that the celebration of their
funeral approaches?</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Assuredly. But whom have they chosen?</p>

<p><i>Menexenus.</i> The election is deferred until to-morrow;
I imagine that either Dion or Archinus will be chosen.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> In truth, Menexenus, the condition of him
who dies in battle is, in every respect, fortunate and
glorious. If he is poor, he is conducted to his tomb
with a magnificent and honourable funeral, amidst the
praises of all; if even he were a coward, his name is
included in a panegyric pronounced by the most learned
men; from which all the vulgar expressions, which
unpremeditated composition might admit, have been
excluded by the careful labour of leisure; who praise
so admirably, enlarging upon every topic remotely or
immediately connected with the subject, and blending
so eloquent a variety of expressions, that, praising in
every manner the state of which we are citizens, and
those who have perished in battle, and the ancestors
who preceded our generation, and ourselves who yet
live, they steal away our spirits as with enchantment.
Whilst I listen to their praises, O Menexenus, I am
penetrated with a very lofty conception of myself, and
overcome by their flatteries. I appear to myself immeasurably
more honourable and generous than before,
and many of the strangers who are accustomed to
accompany me, regard me with additional veneration,
after having heard these relations; they seem to consider
the whole state, including me, much more
worthy of admiration, after they have been soothed
into persuasion by the orator. The opinion thus
inspired of my own majesty will last me more than
three days sometimes, and the penetrating melody of
the words descends through the ears into the mind, and
clings to it; so that it is often three or four days before
I come to my senses sufficiently to perceive in what
part of the world I am, or succeed in persuading myself<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
that I do not inhabit one of the islands of the blessed.
So skilful are these orators of ours.</p>

<p><i>Menexenus.</i> Thou always laughest at the orators, O
Socrates. On the present occasion, however, the unforeseen
election will preclude the person chosen from the
advantages of a preconcerted speech: the speaker will
probably be reduced to the necessity of extemporising.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> How so, my good friend? Every one of
the candidates has, without doubt, his oration prepared;
and if not, there were little difficulty, on this occasion, of
inventing an unpremeditated speech. If, indeed, the
question were of Athenians, who should speak in the
Peloponnesus; or of Peloponnesians, who should speak
at Athens, an orator who would persuade and be
applauded, must employ all the resources of his skill.
But to the orator who contends for the approbation of
those whom he praises, success will be little difficult.</p>

<p><i>Menexenus.</i> Is that thy opinion, O Socrates?</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> In truth it is.</p>

<p><i>Menexenus.</i> Shouldst thou consider thyself competent
to pronounce this oration, if thou shouldst be chosen by
the senate?</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> There would be nothing astonishing if I
should consider myself equal to such an undertaking.
My mistress in oratory was perfect in the science which
she taught, and had formed many other excellent orators,
and one of the most eminent among the Greeks, Pericles,
the son of Xantippus.</p>

<p><i>Menexenus.</i> Who is she? Assuredly thou meanest
Aspasia.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Aspasia, and Connus the son of Metrobius,
the two instructors. From the former of these I learned
rhetoric, and from the latter music. There would be
nothing wonderful if a man so educated should be capable
of great energy of speech. A person who should have
been instructed in a manner totally different from me;
who should have learned rhetoric from Antiphon the<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
son of Rhamnusius, and music from Lampses, would
be competent to succeed in such an attempt as praising
the Athenians to the Athenians.</p>

<p><i>Menexenus.</i> And what shouldst thou have to say, if
thou wert chosen to pronounce the oration?</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Of my own, probably nothing. But yesterday
I heard Aspasia declaim a funeral oration over
these same persons. She had heard, as thou sayest,
that the Athenians were about to choose an orator, and
she took the occasion of suggesting a series of topics
proper for such an orator to select; in part extemporaneously,
and in part such as she had already prepared.
I think it probable that she composed the
oration by interweaving such fragments of oratory as
Pericles might have left.</p>

<p><i>Menexenus.</i> Rememberest thou what Aspasia said?</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> Unless I am greatly mistaken. I learned
it from her; and she is so good a school-mistress, that
I should have been beaten if I had not been perfect in
my lesson.</p>

<p><i>Menexenus.</i> Why not repeat it to me?</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> I fear lest my mistress be angry, should I
publish her discourse.</p>

<p><i>Menexenus.</i> O, fear not. At least deliver a discourse;
you will do what is exceedingly delightful to me, whether
it be of Aspasia or any other. I entreat you to do me
this pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> But you will laugh at me, who, being old,
attempt to repeat a pleasant discourse.</p>

<p><i>Menexenus.</i> O no, Socrates; I entreat you to speak,
however it may be.</p>

<p><i>Socrates.</i> I see that I must do what you require. In
a little while, if you should ask me to strip naked and
dance, I shall be unable to refuse you, at least, if we
are alone. Now, listen. She spoke thus, if I recollect,
beginning with the dead, in whose honour the oration is
supposed to have been delivered.</p>

<small>FROM THE REPUBLIC OF PLATO</small>.</h2>

<p>I. But it would be almost impossible to build your
city in such a situation that it would need no
imposts?&mdash;Impossible.&mdash;Other persons would
then be required, who might undertake to conduct from
another city those things of which they stood in need?&mdash;Certainly.&mdash;But
the merchant who should return to his
own city, without any of those articles which it needed,
would return empty-handed. It will be necessary, therefore,
not only to produce a sufficient supply, but such
articles, both in quantity and in kind, as may be
required to remunerate those who conduct the imports.
There will be needed then more husbandmen, and other
artificers, in our city. There will be needed also other
persons who will undertake the conveyance of the imports
and the exports, and these persons are called merchants.
If the commerce which these necessities produce is
carried on by sea, other persons will be required who
are accustomed to nautical affairs. And, in the city
itself, how shall the products of each man’s labour be
transported from one to another; those products, for
the sake of the enjoyment and the ready distribution
of which, they were first induced to institute a civil
society?&mdash;By selling and buying, surely.&mdash;A market<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
and money, as a symbol of exchange, arises out of this
necessity?&mdash;Evidently.&mdash;When the husbandman, or any
other artificer, brings the produce of his labours to the
public place, and those who desire to barter their produce
for it do not happen to arrive exactly at the same
time, would he not lose his time, and the profit of it,
if he were to sit in the market waiting for them?&mdash;Assuredly.&mdash;But,
there are persons, who, perceiving
this, will take upon themselves the arrangement between
the buyer and the seller. In constituted civil societies,
those who are employed on this service, ought to be the
infirm, and unable to perform any other; but, exchanging
on one hand for money, what any person comes to sell,
and giving the articles thus bought for a similar equivalent
to those who might wish to buy.</p>

<p>II. Description of a frugal enjoyment of the goods of
the world.</p>

<p>III. But with this system of life some are not contented.
They must have beds and tables, and other
furniture. They must have scarce ointments and perfumes,
women, and a thousand superfluities of the
same character. The things which we mentioned as
sufficient, houses, and clothes, and food, are not enough.
Painting and mosaic-work must be cultivated, and works
in gold and ivory. The society must be enlarged in
consequence. This city, which is of a healthy proportion,
will not suffice, but it must be replenished with
a multitude of persons, whose occupations are by no
means indispensable. Huntsmen and mimics, persons
whose occupation it is to arrange forms and colours,
persons whose trade is the cultivation of the more
delicate arts, poets and their ministers, rhapsodists,
actors, dancers, manufacturers of all kinds of instruments
and schemes of female dress, and an immense
crowd of other ministers to pleasure and necessity. Do<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
you not think we should want schoolmasters, tutors,
nurses, hair-dressers, barbers, manufacturers and cooks?
Should we not want pig-drivers, which were not wanted
in our more modest city, in this one, and a multitude of
others to administer to other animals, which would then
become necessary articles of food,&mdash;or should we not?&mdash;Certainly
we should.&mdash;Should we not want physicians
much more, living in this manner than before? The
same tract of country would no longer provide sustenance
for the state. Must we then not usurp from the
territory of our neighbours, and then we should make
aggressions, and so we have discovered the origin of
war; which is the principal cause of the greatest public
and private calamities.&mdash;C. xi.</p>

<p>IV. And first, we must improve upon the composers
of fabulous histories in verse, to compose them according
to the rules of moral beauty; and those not composed
according to the rules must be rejected; and we
must persuade mothers and nurses to teach those which
we approve to their children, and to form their minds
by moral fables, far more than their bodies by their
hands.&mdash;Lib. ii.</p>

<h3 class="hanging2">V. ON THE DANGER OF THE STUDY OF ALLEGORICAL
COMPOSITION (IN A LARGE SENSE) FOR YOUNG
PEOPLE.</h3>

<p>For a young person is not competent to judge what
portions of a fabulous composition are allegorical and
what literal; but the opinions produced by a literal
acceptation of that which has no meaning, or a bad
one, except in an allegorical sense, are often irradicable.&mdash;Lib
ii.</p>

<p>VI.&mdash;God then, since he is good, cannot be, as is
vulgarly supposed, the cause of all things; he is the<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
cause, indeed, of very few things. Among the great
variety of events which happen in the course of human
affairs, evil prodigiously overbalances good in everything
which regards men. Of all that is good there can
be no other cause than God; but some other cause
ought to be discovered for evil, which should never be
imputed as an effect to God.&mdash;L. ii.</p>

<p>VII.&mdash;Plato’s doctrine of punishment, as laid down
[here], is refuted by his previous reasonings.</p>

<h3>VIII.&mdash;THE UNCHANGEABLE NATURE OF GOD.</h3>

<p>Do you think that God is like a vulgar conjuror, and
that he is capable for the sake of effect, of assuming,
at one time, one form, and at another time, another?
Now, in his own character, converting his proper form
into a multitude of shapes, now deceiving us, and
offering vain images of himself to our imagination?
Or do you think that God is single and one, and least
of all things capable of departing from his permanent
nature and appearance?</p>

<h3>IX.&mdash;THE PERMANENCY OF WHAT IS EXCELLENT.</h3>

<p>But everything, in proportion as it is excellent, either
in art or nature, or in both, is least susceptible of
receiving change from any external influence.</p>

<h3>X.&mdash;AGAINST SUPERSTITIOUS TALES.</h3>

<p>Nor should mothers terrify their children by these
fables, that Gods go about in the night-time, resembling
strangers, in all sorts of forms: at once blaspheming
the Gods and rendering their children cowardly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<h3>XI.&mdash;THE TRUE ESSENCE OF FALSEHOOD AND ITS
ORIGIN.</h3>

<p>Know you not that, that which is truly false, if it
may be permitted me so to speak, all, both gods and
men detest?&mdash;How do you mean?&mdash;Thus: No person
is willing to falsify in matters of the highest concern to
himself concerning those matters, but fears, above all
things, lest he should accept falsehood.&mdash;Yet, I understand
you not.&mdash;You think that I mean something
profound. I say that no person is willing in his own
mind to receive or to assert a falsehood, to be ignorant,
to be in error, to possess that which is not true. This
is truly to be called falsehood, this ignorance and error
in the mind itself. What is usually called falsehood, or
deceit in words, is but a voluntary imitation of what the
mind itself suffers in the involuntary possession of that
falsehood, an image of later birth, and scarcely, in a
strict and complete sense, deserving the name of falsehood.&mdash;Lib.
ii.</p>

<h3>XII.&mdash;AGAINST A BELIEF IN HELL.</h3>

<p>If they are to possess courage, are not those doctrines
alone to be taught, which render death least terrible?
Or do you conceive that any man can be brave who is
subjected to a fear of death? that he who believes the
things that are related of hell, and thinks that they are
truth, will prefer in battle, death to slavery, or defeat?&mdash;Lib.
iii.&mdash;<i>Then follows a criticism on the poetical
accounts of hell.</i></p>

<h3>XIII.&mdash;ON GRIEF.</h3>

<p>We must then abolish the custom of lamenting and
commiserating the deaths of illustrious men. Do we
assert that an excellent man will consider it anything
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
dreadful that his intimate friend, who is also an excellent
man, should die?&mdash;By no means (<i>an excessive
refinement</i>). He will abstain then from lamenting over
his loss, as if he had suffered some great evil?&mdash;Surely.&mdash;May
we not assert in addition, that such a person as
we have described suffices to himself for all purposes
of living well and happily, and in no manner needs the
assistance or society of another? that he would endure
with resignation the destitution of a son, or a brother,
or possessions, or whatever external adjuncts of life
might have been attached to him? and that, on the
occurrence of such contingencies, he would support
them with moderation and mildness, by no means
bursting into lamentations, or resigning himself to
despondence?&mdash;Lib. iii.</p>

<p><i>Then he proceeds to allege passages of the poets in
which opposite examples were held up to approbation
and imitation.</i></p>

<h3>XIV.&mdash;THE INFLUENCE OF EARLY CONSTANT
IMITATION.</h3>

<p>Do you not apprehend that imitations, if they shall
have been practised and persevered in from early youth,
become established in the habits and nature, in the
gestures of the body, and the tones of the voice, and
lastly, in the intellect itself?&mdash;C. iii.</p>

<h3>XV.&mdash;ON THE EFFECT OF BAD TASTE IN ART.</h3>

<p>Nor must we restrict the poets alone to an exhibition
of the example of virtuous manners in their compositions,
but all other artists must be forbidden, either in
sculpture, or painting, or architecture, to employ their
skill upon forms of an immoral, unchastened, monstrous,
or illiberal type, either in the forms of living beings, or
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
in architectural arrangements. And the artist capable
of this employment of his art, must not be suffered in
our community, lest those destined to be guardians of
the society, nourished upon images of deformity and
vice, like cattle upon bad grass, gradually gathering and
depasturing every day a little, may ignorantly establish
one great evil composed of these many evil things, in
their minds.&mdash;C. iii.</p>

<p><i>The monstrous figures called Arabesques, however in
some of them is to be found a mixture of a truer and
simpler taste, which are found in the ruined palaces of
the Roman Emperors, bear, nevertheless, the same relation
to the brutal profligacy and killing luxury which
required them, as the majestic figures of Castor and
Pollux, and the simple beauty of the sculpture of the
frieze of the Parthenon, bear to the more beautiful and
simple manners of the Greeks of that period. With a
liberal interpretation, a similar analogy might be extended
into literary composition.</i></p>

<h3>XVI.&mdash;AGAINST THE LEARNED PROFESSIONS.</h3>

<p>What better evidence can you require of a corrupt
and pernicious system of discipline in a state, than that
not merely persons of base habits and plebeian employments,
but men who pretend to have received a liberal
education, require the assistance of lawyers and physicians,
and those too who have attained to a singular
degree (so desperate are these diseases of body and
mind) of skill. Do you not consider it an abject necessity,
a proof of the deepest degradation, to need to be
instructed in what is just or what is needful, as by a
master and a judge, with regard to your personal knowledge
and suffering?</p>

<p><i>What would Plato have said to a priest, such as his
office is in modern times?</i>&mdash;C. iii.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<h3>XVII.&mdash;ON MEDICINE.</h3>

<p>Do you not think it an abject thing to require the
assistance of the medicinal art, not for the cure of
wounds, or such external diseases as result from the
accidents of the seasons (επητειην), but on account of
sloth and the superfluous indulgences which we have
already condemned; this being filled with wind and
water, like holes in earth, and compelling the elegant
successors of Æsculapius to invent new names, flatulences,
and catarrhs, &amp;c., for the new diseases which are
the progeny of your luxury and sloth?&mdash;L. iii.</p>

<h3>XVIII.&mdash;THE EFFECT OF THE DIETETIC SYSTEM.</h3>

<p>Herodicus being pædotribe (παιδοτρίβης, <i>Magister
palæstræ</i>), and his health becoming weak, united the
gymnastic with the medical art, and having condemned
himself to a life of weariness, afterwards extended the
same pernicious system to others. He made his life a
long death. For humouring the disease, mortal in its
own nature, to which he was subject, without being able
to cure it, he postponed all other purposes to the care
of medicating himself, and through his whole life was
subject to an access of his malady, if he departed in
any degree from his accustomed diet, and by the employment
of this skill, dying by degrees, he arrived at an
old age.&mdash;L. iii.</p>

<p>Æsculapius never pursued these systems, nor Machaon
or Podalirius. They never undertook the treatment
of those whose frames were inwardly and thoroughly
diseased, so to prolong a worthless existence, and
bestow on a man a long and wretched being, during
which they might generate children in every respect the
inheritors of their infirmity.&mdash;L. iii.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<h3>XIX.&mdash;AGAINST WHAT IS FALSELY CALLED “KNOWLEDGE
OF THE WORLD.”</h3>

<p>A man ought not to be a good judge until he be old;
because he ought not have acquired a knowledge of
what injustice is, until his understanding has arrived
at maturity: not apprehending its nature from a consideration
of its existence in himself; but having contemplated
it distinct from his own nature in that of
others, for a long time, until he shall perceive what an
evil it is, not from his own experience and its effects
within himself, but from his observations of them as
resulting in others. Such a one were indeed an honourable
judge, and a good; for he who has a good mind,
is good. But that judge who is considered so wise,
who having himself committed great injustice, is supposed
to be qualified for the detection of it in others,
and who is quick to suspect, appears keen, indeed, as
long as he associates with those who resemble him;
because, deriving experience from the example afforded
by a consideration of his own conduct and character,
he acts with caution; but when he associates with men
of universal experience and real virtue, he exposes the
defects resulting from such experience as he possesses,
by distrusting men unreasonably and mistaking true
virtue, having no example of it within himself with which
to compare the appearances manifested in others: yet,
such a one finding more associates who are virtuous
than such as are wise, necessarily appears, both to himself
and others, rather to be wise than foolish.&mdash;But we
ought rather to search for a wise and good judge; one
who has examples within himself of that upon which he
is to pronounce.&mdash;C. iii.</p>

<p>XX.&mdash;Those who use gymnastics unmingled with
music become too savage, whilst those who use music
unmingled with gymnastics, become more delicate than
is befitting.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<h3>[<i>Prefatory note by Mrs. Shelley.</i>]</h3>

<p>It is well known that when Socrates was condemned to death,
his friends made arrangements for his escape from prison and his
after security; of which he refused to avail himself, from the reason,
that a good citizen ought to obey the laws of his country. On this
Shelley makes the following remarks&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p class="dropcap-first-letter">The reply is simple,
Indeed, your city cannot subsist, because the
laws are no longer of avail. For how can the
laws be said to exist, when those who deserve to be
nourished in the Prytanea at the public expense, are
condemned to suffer the penalties only due to the most
atrocious criminals; whilst those against, and to protect
from whose injustice, the laws were framed, live in
honour and security? I neither overthrow your state,
nor infringe your laws. Although you have inflicted an
injustice on me, which is sufficient, according to the
opinions of the multitude, to authorise me to consider
you and me as in a state of warfare; yet, had I the
power, so far from inflicting any revenge, I would
endeavour to overcome you by benefits. All that I do
at present is, that which the peaceful traveller would do,
who, caught by robbers in a forest, escapes from them
whilst they are engaged in the division of the spoil.
And this I do, when it would not only be indifferent,
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
but delightful to me to die, surrounded by my friends,
secure of the inheritance of glory, and escaping, after
such a life as mine, from the decay of mind and body
which must soon begin to be my portion should I live.
But I prefer the good, which I have it in my power yet
to perform.</p>

<p>Such are the arguments which overturn the sophism
placed in the mouth of Socrates by Plato. But there
are others which prove that he did well to die.</p>

<p class="h2sub fantasy">A Fragment of a Romance.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="dropcap-first-letter">Jerusalem, goaded on to resistance by the
incessant usurpations and insolence of Rome,
leagued together its discordant factions to rebel
against the common enemy and tyrant. Inferior to
their foe in all but the unconquerable hope of liberty,
they surrounded their city with fortifications of uncommon
strength, and placed in array before the temple a
band rendered desperate by patriotism and religion.
Even the women preferred to die, rather than survive
the ruin of their country. When the Roman army
approached the walls of the sacred city, its preparations,
its discipline, and its numbers, evinced the conviction of
its leader, that he had no common barbarians to subdue.
At the approach of the Roman army, the strangers
withdrew from the city.</p>

<p>Among the multitudes which from every nation of the
East had assembled at Jerusalem, was a little congregation
of Christians. They were remarkable neither for
their numbers nor their importance. They contained
among them neither philosophers nor poets. Acknowledging
no laws but those of God, they modelled their<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
conduct towards their fellow-men by the conclusions of
their individual judgment on the practical application of
these laws. And it was apparent from the simplicity and
severity of their manners, that this contempt for human
institutions had produced among them a character
superior in singleness and sincere self-apprehension to
the slavery of pagan customs and the gross delusions of
antiquated superstition. Many of their opinions considerably
resembled those of the sect afterwards known
by the name of Gnostics. They esteemed the human
understanding to be the paramount rule of human
conduct; they maintained that the obscurest religious
truth required for its complete elucidation no more than
the strenuous application of the energies of mind. It
appeared impossible to them that any doctrine could be
subversive of social happiness which is not capable of
being confuted by arguments derived from the nature of
existing things. With the devoutest submission to the
law of Christ, they united an intrepid spirit of inquiry as
to the correctest mode of acting in particular instances
of conduct that occur among men. Assuming the
doctrines of the Messiah concerning benevolence and
justice for the regulation of their actions, they could not
be persuaded to acknowledge that there was apparent
in the divine code any prescribed rule whereby, for
its own sake, one action rather than another, as fulfilling
the will of their great Master, should be preferred.</p>

<p>The contempt with which the magistracy and priesthood
regarded this obscure community of speculators,
had hitherto protected them from persecution. But
they had arrived at that precise degree of eminence and
prosperity which is peculiarly obnoxious to the hostility
of the rich and powerful. The moment of their departure
from Jerusalem was the crisis of their future destiny.
Had they continued to seek a precarious refuge in a city
of the Roman empire, this persecution would not have<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
delayed to impress a new character on their opinions
and their conduct; narrow views, and the illiberality of
sectarian patriotism, would not have failed speedily to
obliterate the magnificence and beauty of their wild and
wonderful condition.</p>

<p>Attached from principle to peace, despising and
hating the pleasures and the customs of the degenerate
mass of mankind, this unostentatious community of good
and happy men fled to the solitudes of Lebanon. To
Arabians and enthusiasts the solemnity and grandeur
of these desolate recesses possessed peculiar attractions.
It well accorded with the justice of their conceptions on
the relative duties of man towards his fellow in society,
that they should labour in unconstrained equality to
dispossess the wolf and the tiger of their empire, and
establish on its ruins the dominion of intelligence and
virtue. No longer would the worshippers of the God of
Nature be indebted to a hundred hands for the accommodation
of their simple wants. No longer would the
poison of a diseased civilization embrue their very
nutriment with pestilence. They would no longer owe
their very existence to the vices, the fears, and the follies
of mankind. Love, friendship, and philanthropy, would
now be the characteristic disposers of their industry. It
is for his mistress or his friend that the labourer consecrates
his toil; others are mindful, but he is forgetful,
of himself. “God feeds the hungry ravens, and clothes
the lilies of the fields, and yet Solomon in all his glory
is not like to one of these.”</p>

<p>Rome was now the shadow of her former self. The
light of her grandeur and loveliness had passed away.
The latest and the noblest of her poets and historians
had foretold in agony her approaching slavery and
degradation. The ruins of the human mind, more
awful and portentous than the desolation of the most
solemn temples, threw a shade of gloom upon her golden
palaces which the brutal vulgar could not see, but which<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
the mighty felt with inward trepidation and despair.
The ruins of Jerusalem lay defenceless and uninhabited
upon the burning sands; none visited, but in the depth
of solemn awe, this accursed and solitary spot. Tradition
says that there was seen to linger among the
scorched and shattered fragments of the temple, one
being, whom he that saw dared not to call man, with
clasped hands, immoveable eyes, and a visage horribly
serene. Not on the will of the capricious multitude,
nor the constant fluctuations of the many and the weak,
depends the change of empires and religions. These
are the mere insensible elements from which a subtler
intelligence moulds its enduring statuary. They that
direct the changes of this mortal scene breathe the decrees
of their dominion from a throne of darkness and
of tempest. The power of man is great.</p>

<p>After many days of wandering, the Assassins pitched
their tents in the valley of Bethzatanai. For ages had
this fertile valley lain concealed from the adventurous
search of man, among mountains of everlasting snow.
The men of elder days had inhabited this spot. Piles
of monumental marble and fragments of columns that in
their integrity almost seemed the work of some intelligence
more sportive and fantastic than the gross conceptions
of mortality, lay in heaps beside the lake, and
were visible beneath its transparent waves. The flowering
orange-tree, the balsam, and innumerable odoriferous
shrubs, grew wild in the desolated portals. The
fountain tanks had overflowed, and amid the luxuriant
vegetation of their margin, the yellow snake held its
unmolested dwelling. Hither came the tiger and the
bear to contend for those once domestic animals who
had forgotten the secure servitude of their ancestors.
No sound, when the famished beast of prey had retreated
in despair from the awful desolation of this place, at
whose completion he had assisted, but the shrill cry of
the stork, and the flapping of his heavy wings from the<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
capital of the solitary column, and the scream of the
hungry vulture baffled of its only victim. The lore of
ancient wisdom was sculptured in mystic characters on
the rocks. The human spirit and the human hand had
been busy here to accomplish its profoundest miracles.
It was a temple dedicated to the god of knowledge and
of truth. The palaces of the Caliphs and the Cæsars
might easily surpass these ruins in magnitude and
sumptuousness: but they were the design of tyrants and
the work of slaves. Piercing genius and consummate
prudence had planned and executed Bethzatanai. There
was deep and important meaning in every lineament of
its fantastic sculpture. The unintelligible legend, once
so beautiful and perfect, so full of poetry and history,
spoke, even in destruction, volumes of mysterious import,
and obscure significance.</p>

<p>But in the season of its utmost prosperity and magnificence,
art might not aspire to vie with nature in the
valley of Bethzatanai. All that was wonderful and lovely
was collected in this deep seclusion. The fluctuating
elements seemed to have been rendered everlastingly
permanent in forms of wonder and delight. The mountains
of Lebanon had been divided to their base to form
this happy valley; on every side their icy summits darted
their white pinnacles into the clear blue sky, imaging,
in their grotesque outline, minarets, and ruined domes,
and columns worn with time. Far below, the silver
clouds rolled their bright volumes in many beautiful
shapes, and fed the eternal springs, that, spanning the
dark chasms like a thousand radiant rainbows, leaped
into the quiet vale, then, lingering in many a dark glade
among the groves of cypress and of palm, lost themselves
in the lake. The immensity of these precipitous mountains
with their starry pyramids of snow, excluded the
sun, which overtopped not, even in its meridian, their
overhanging rocks. But a more heavenly and serener
light was reflected from their icy mirrors, which,<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
piercing through the many-tinted clouds, produced
lights and colours of inexhaustible variety. The herbage
was perpetually verdant, and clothed the darkest
recesses of the caverns and the woods.</p>

<p>Nature, undisturbed, had become an enchantress in
these solitudes; she had collected here all that was
wonderful and divine from the armoury of her omnipotence.
The very winds breathed health and renovation,
and the joyousness of youthful courage. Fountains of
crystalline water played perpetually among the aromatic
flowers, and mingled a freshness with their odour. The
pine boughs became instruments of exquisite contrivance,
among which every varying breeze waked music of new
and more delightful melody. Meteoric shapes, more
effulgent than the moonlight, hung on the wandering
clouds, and mixed in discordant dance around the spiral
fountains. Blue vapours assumed strange lineaments
under the rocks and among the ruins, lingering like
ghosts with slow and solemn step. Through a dark
chasm to the east, in the long perspective of a portal
glittering with the unnumbered riches of the subterranean
world, shone the broad moon, pouring in one yellow and
unbroken stream her horizontal beams. Nearer the icy
region, autumn and spring held an alternate reign. The
sere leaves fell and choked the sluggish brooks; the
chilling fogs hung diamonds on every spray; and in the
dark cold evening the howling winds made melancholy
music in the trees. Far above, shone the bright throne
of winter, clear, cold, and dazzling. Sometimes there
was seen the snow-flakes to fall before the sinking orb
of the beamless sun, like a shower of fiery sulphur. The
cataracts, arrested in their course, seemed, with their
transparent columns, to support the dark-browed rocks.
Sometimes the icy whirlwind scooped the powdery snow
aloft, to mingle with the hissing meteors, and scatter
spangles through the rare and rayless atmosphere.</p>

<p>Such strange scenes of chaotic confusion and harrowing<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
sublimity, surrounding and shutting in the vale,
added to the delights of its secure and voluptuous tranquillity.
No spectator could have refused to believe
that some spirit of great intelligence and power had
hallowed these wild and beautiful solitudes to a deep
and solemn mystery.</p>

<p>The immediate effect of such a scene, suddenly presented
to the contemplation of mortal eyes, is seldom
the subject of authentic record. The coldest slave of
custom cannot fail to recollect some few moments in
which the breath of spring or the crowding clouds of
sunset, with the pale moon shining through their fleecy
skirts, or the song of some lonely bird perched on the
only tree of an unfrequented heath, has awakened the
touch of nature. And they were Arabians who entered
the valley of Bethzatanai; men who idolized nature and
the God of nature; to whom love and lofty thoughts,
and the apprehensions of an uncorrupted spirit, were
sustenance and life. Thus securely excluded from an
abhorred world, all thought of its judgment was cancelled
by the rapidity of their fervid imaginations. They
ceased to acknowledge, or deigned not to advert to, the
distinctions with which the majority of base and vulgar
minds control the longings and struggles of the soul
towards its place of rest. A new and sacred fire was
kindled in their hearts and sparkled in their eyes.
Every gesture, every feature, the minutest action, was
modelled to beneficence and beauty by the holy inspiration
that had descended on their searching spirits. The
epidemic transport communicated itself through every
heart with the rapidity of a blast from heaven. They
were already disembodied spirits; they were already
the inhabitants of paradise. To live, to breathe, to
move, was itself a sensation of immeasurable transport.
Every new contemplation of the condition of his nature
brought to the happy enthusiast an added measure of
delight, and impelled to every organ, where mind is<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
united with external things, a keener and more exquisite
perception of all that they contain of lovely and divine.
To love, to be beloved, suddenly became an insatiable
famine of his nature, which the wide circle of the
universe, comprehending beings of such inexhaustible
variety and stupendous magnitude of excellence appeared
too narrow and confined to satiate.</p>

<p>Alas, that these visitings of the spirit of life should
fluctuate and pass away! That the moments when the
human mind is commensurate with all that it can conceive
of excellent and powerful, should not endure with
its existence and survive its most momentous change!
But the beauty of a vernal sunset, with its overhanging
curtains of empurpled cloud, is rapidly dissolved, to
return at some unexpected period, and spread an alleviating
melancholy over the dark vigils of despair.</p>

<p>It is true the enthusiasm of overwhelming transport
which had inspired every breast among the Assassins is
no more. The necessity of daily occupation and the
ordinariness of that human life, the burthen of which it is
the destiny of every human being to bear, had smothered,
not extinguished, that divine and eternal fire. Not the
less indelible and permanent were the impressions
communicated to all; not the more unalterably were
the features of their social character modelled and
determined by its influence.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p>Rome had fallen. Her senate-house had become a
polluted den of thieves and liars; her solemn temples,
the arena of theological disputants, who made fire and
sword the missionaries of their inconceivable beliefs.
The city of the monster Constantine, symbolising, in
the consequences of its foundation, the wickedness and<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
weakness of his successors, feebly imaged with declining
power the substantial eminence of the Roman name.
Pilgrims of a new and mightier faith crowded to visit
the lonely ruins of Jerusalem, and weep and pray before
the sepulchre of the Eternal God. The earth was filled
with discord, tumult, and ruin. The spirit of disinterested
virtue had armed one-half of the civilised world against
the other. Monstrous and detestable creeds poisoned
and blighted the domestic charities. There was no
appeal to natural love, or ancient faith, from pride,
superstition, and revenge.</p>

<p>Four centuries had passed thus terribly characterised
by the most calamitous revolutions. The Assassins,
meanwhile, undisturbed by the surrounding tumult,
possessed and cultivated their fertile valley. The
gradual operation of their peculiar condition had matured
and perfected the singularity and excellence of their
character. That cause, which had ceased to act as
an immediate and overpowering excitement, became
the unperceived law of their lives, and sustenance of
their natures. Their religious tenets had also undergone
a change, corresponding with the exalted condition
of their moral being. The gratitude which they owed
to the benignant Spirit by which their limited intelligences
had not only been created but redeemed, was
less frequently adverted to, became less the topic of
comment or contemplation; not, therefore, did it cease
to be their presiding guardian, the guide of their inmost
thoughts, the tribunal of appeal for the minutest particulars
of their conduct. They learned to identify this
mysterious benefactor with the delight that is bred
among the solitary rocks, and has its dwelling alike
in the changing colours of the clouds and the inmost
recesses of the caverns. Their future also no longer
existed, but in the blissful tranquillity of the present.
Time was measured and created by the vices and
the miseries of men, between whom and the happy<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
nation of the Assassins there was no analogy nor comparison.
Already had their eternal peace commenced.
The darkness had passed away from the open gates of
death.</p>

<p>The practical results produced by their faith and
condition upon their external conduct were singular
and memorable. Excluded from the great and various
community of mankind, these solitudes became to them
a sacred hermitage, in which all formed, as it were,
one being, divided against itself by no contending will
or factious passions. Every impulse conspired to one
end, and tended to a single object. Each devoted his
powers to the happiness of the other. Their republic
was the scene of the perpetual contentions of benevolence;
not the heartless and assumed kindness of
commercial man, but the genuine virtue that has a
legible superscription in every feature of the countenance,
and every motion of the frame. The perverseness
and calamities of those who dwelt beyond the
mountains that encircled their undisturbed possessions,
were unknown and unimagined. Little embarrassed
by the complexities of civilised society, they knew not
to conceive any happiness that can be satiated without
participation, or that thirsts not to reproduce and perpetually
generate itself. The path of virtue and felicity
was plain and unimpeded. They clearly acknowledged,
in every case, that conduct to be entitled to preference
which would obviously produce the greatest pleasure.
They could not conceive an instance in which it would
be their duty to hesitate, in causing, at whatever expense,
the greatest and most unmixed delight.</p>

<p>Hence arose a peculiarity which only failed to germinate
in uncommon and momentous consequences,
because the Assassins had retired from the intercourse
of mankind, over whom other motives and principles of
conduct than justice and benevolence prevail. It would
be a difficult matter for men of such a sincere and<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
simple faith, to estimate the final results of their intentions,
among the corrupt and slavish multitude. They
would be perplexed also in their choice of the means,
whereby their intentions might be fulfilled. To produce
immediate pain or disorder for the sake of future benefit,
is consonant, indeed, with the purest religion and philosophy,
but never fails to excite invincible repugnance in
the feelings of the many. Against their predilections
and distastes an Assassin, accidentally the inhabitant of
a civilised community, would wage unremitting hostility
from principle. He would find himself compelled to
adopt means which they would abhor, for the sake of
an object which they could not conceive that he should
propose to himself. Secure and self-enshrined in the
magnificence and pre-eminence of his conceptions, spotless
as the light of heaven, he would be the victim
among men of calumny and persecution. Incapable
of distinguishing his motives, they would rank him
among the vilest and most atrocious criminals. Great,
beyond all comparison with them, they would despise
him in the presumption of their ignorance. Because
his spirit burned with an unquenchable passion for their
welfare, they would lead him, like his illustrious master,
amidst scoffs, and mockery, and insult, to the remuneration
of an ignominious death.</p>

<p>Who hesitates to destroy a venomous serpent that
has crept near his sleeping friend, except the man who
selfishly dreads lest the malignant reptile should turn
its fury on himself? And if the poisoner has assumed
a human shape, if the bane be distinguished only from
the viper’s venom by the excess and extent of its
devastation, will the saviour and avenger here retract
and pause, entrenched behind the superstition of the
indefeasible divinity of man? Is the human form,
then, the mere badge of a prerogative for unlicensed
wickedness and mischief? Can the power derived
from the weakness of the oppressed, or the ignorance
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
of the deceived, confer the right in security to tyrannise
and defraud?</p>

<p>The subject of regular governments, and the disciple
of established superstition, dares not to ask this question.
For the sake of the eventual benefit, he endures what
he esteems a transitory evil, and the moral degradation
of man disquiets not his patience. But the religion
of an Assassin imposes other virtues than endurance,
when his fellow-men groan under tyranny, or have
become so bestial and abject that they cannot feel
their chains. An Assassin believes that man is eminently
man, and only then enjoys the prerogatives of
his privileged condition, when his affections and his
judgment pay tribute to the God of Nature. The
perverse, and vile, and vicious&mdash;what were they?
Shapes of some unholy vision, moulded by the spirit
of Evil, which the sword of the merciful destroyer
should sweep from this beautiful world. Dreamy
nothings; phantasms of misery and mischief, that
hold their death-like state on glittering thrones, and
in the loathsome dens of poverty. No Assassin would
submissively temporise with vice, and in cold charity
become a pander to falsehood and desolation. His
path through the wilderness of civilized society would
be marked with the blood of the oppressor and the
ruiner. The wretch, whom nations tremblingly adore,
would expiate in his throttling grasp a thousand licensed
and venerable crimes.</p>

<p>How many holy liars and parasites, in solemn guise,
would his saviour arm drag from their luxurious couches,
and plunge in the cold charnel, that the green and
many-legged monsters of the slimy grave might eat off
at their leisure the lineaments of rooted malignity and
detested cunning. The respectable man&mdash;the smooth,
smiling, polished villain, whom all the city honours;
whose very trade is lies and murder; who buys his
daily bread with the blood and tears of men, would<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
feed the ravens with his limbs. The Assassin would
cater nobly for the eyeless worms of earth, and the
carrion fowls of heaven.</p>

<p>Yet here, religion and human love had imbued the
manners of those solitary people with inexpressible
gentleness and benignity. Courage and active virtue,
and the indignation against vice, which becomes a
hurrying and irresistible passion, slept like the imprisoned
earthquake, or the lightning shafts that hang
in the golden clouds of evening. They were innocent,
but they were capable of more than innocence; for the
great principles of their faith were perpetually acknowledged
and adverted to; nor had they forgotten, in this
uninterrupted quiet, the author of their felicity.</p>

<p>Four centuries had thus worn away without producing
an event. Men had died, and natural tears had
been shed upon their graves, in sorrow that improves
the heart. Those who had been united by love had
gone to death together, leaving to their friends the
bequest of a most sacred grief, and of a sadness that
is allied to pleasure. Babes that hung upon their
mothers’ breasts had become men; men had died;
and many a wild luxuriant weed that overtopped the
habitations of the vale, had twined its roots around
their disregarded bones. Their tranquil state was like
a summer sea, whose gentle undulations disturb not the
reflected stars, and break not the long still line of the
rainbow hues of sunrise.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p>Where all is thus calm, the slightest circumstance is
recorded and remembered. Before the sixth century
had expired one incident occurred, remarkable and
strange. A young man, named Albedir, wandering<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
in the woods, was startled by the screaming of a bird
of prey, and, looking up, saw blood fall, drop by drop,
from among the intertwined boughs of a cedar. Having
climbed the tree, he beheld a terrible and dismaying
spectacle. A naked human body was impaled on the
broken branch. It was maimed and mangled horribly;
every limb bent and bruised into frightful distortion,
and exhibiting a breathing image of the most sickening
mockery of life. A monstrous snake had scented its
prey from among the mountains&mdash;and above hovered a
hungry vulture. From amidst this mass of desolated
humanity, two eyes, black and inexpressibly brilliant,
shone with an unearthly lustre. Beneath the blood-stained
eye-brows their steady rays manifested the
serenity of an immortal power, the collected energy
of a deathless mind, spell-secured from dissolution. A
bitter smile of mingled abhorrence and scorn distorted
his wounded lip&mdash;he appeared calmly to observe and
measure all around&mdash;self-possession had not deserted
the shattered mass of life.</p>

<p>The youth approached the bough on which the
breathing corpse was hung. As he approached, the
serpent reluctantly unwreathed his glittering coils, and
crept towards his dark and loathsome cave. The
vulture, impatient of his meal, fled to the mountain,
that re-echoed with his hoarse screams. The cedar
branches creaked with their agitating weight, faintly, as
the dismal wind arose. All else was deadly silent.</p>

<p>At length a voice issued from the mangled man. It
rattled in hoarse murmurs from his throat and lungs&mdash;his
words were the conclusion of some strange mysterious
soliloquy. They were broken, and without apparent
connexion, completing wide intervals of inexpressible
conceptions.</p>

<p>“The great tyrant is baffled, even in success. Joy!
joy! to his tortured foe! Triumph to the worm whom
he tramples under his feet! Ha! His suicidal hand
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
might dare as well abolish the mighty frame of things!
Delight and exultation sit before the closed gates of
death!&mdash;I fear not to dwell beneath their black and
ghastly shadow. Here thy power may not avail!
Thou createst&mdash;’tis mine to ruin and destroy.&mdash;I was
thy slave&mdash;I am thy equal, and thy foe.&mdash;Thousands
tremble before thy throne, who, at my voice, shall dare
to pluck the golden crown from thine unholy head!”
He ceased. The silence of noon swallowed up his
words. Albedir clung tighter to the tree&mdash;he dared
not for dismay remove his eyes. He remained mute in
the perturbation of deep and creeping horror.</p>

<p>“Albedir!” said the same voice, “Albedir! in the
name of God, approach. He that suffered me to fall,
watches thee;&mdash;the gentle and merciful spirits of sweet
human love delight not in agony and horror. For
pity’s sake approach, in the name of thy good God,
approach, Albedir!” The tones were mild and clear
as the responses of Æolian music. They floated to
Albedir’s ear like the warm breath of June that lingers
in the lawny groves, subduing all to softness. Tears of
tender affection started into his eyes. It was as the
voice of a beloved friend. The partner of his childhood,
the brother of his soul, seemed to call for aid, and
pathetically to remonstrate with delay. He resisted
not the magic impulse, but advanced towards the spot,
and tenderly attempted to remove the wounded man.
He cautiously descended the tree with his wretched
burthen, and deposited it on the ground.</p>

<p>A period of strange silence intervened. Awe and
cold horror were slowly succeeding to the softer sensations
of tumultuous pity, when again he heard the silver
modulations of the same enchanting voice. “Weep not
for me, Albedir! What wretch so utterly lost, but might
inhale peace and renovation from this paradise! I am
wounded, and in pain; but having found a refuge in this
seclusion, and a friend in you, I am worthier of envy
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
than compassion. Bear me to your cottage secretly:
I would not disturb your gentle partner by my appearance.
She must love me more dearly than a brother.
I must be the playmate of your children; already I
regard them with a father’s love. My arrival must not
be regarded as a thing of mystery and wonder. What,
indeed, but that men are prone to error and exaggeration,
is less inexplicable, than that a stranger, wandering on
Lebanon, fell from the rocks into the vale? Albedir,”
he continued, and his deepening voice assumed awful
solemnity, “in return for the affection with which I
cherish thee and thine, thou owest this submission.”</p>

<p>Albedir implicitly submitted; not even a thought had
power to refuse its deference. He reassumed his burthen,
and proceeded towards the cottage. He watched until
Khaled should be absent, and conveyed the stranger
into an apartment appropriated for the reception of those
who occasionally visited their habitation. He desired
that the door should be securely fastened, and that he
might not be visited until the morning of the following
day.</p>

<p>Albedir waited with impatience for the return of
Khaled. The unaccustomed weight of even so transitory
a secret hung on his ingenuous and unpractised
nature, like a blighting, clinging curse. The stranger’s
accents had lulled him to a trance of wild and delightful
imagination. Hopes, so visionary and aerial, that they
had assumed no denomination, had spread themselves
over his intellectual frame, and, phantoms as they were,
had modelled his being to their shape. Still his mind
was not exempt from the visitings of disquietude and
perturbation. It was a troubled stream of thought, over
whose fluctuating waves unsearchable fate seemed to
preside, guiding its unforeseen alternations with an inexorable
hand. Albedir paced earnestly the garden of
his cottage, revolving every circumstance attendant on
the incident of the day. He re-imaged with intense<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
thought the minutest recollections of the scene. In
vain&mdash;he was the slave of suggestions not to be controlled.
Astonishment, horror, and awe&mdash;tumultuous
sympathy, and a mysterious elevation of soul, hurried
away all activity of judgment, and overwhelmed,
with stunning force, every attempt at deliberation or
inquiry.</p>

<p>His reveries were interrupted at length by the return
of Khaled. She entered the cottage, that scene of undisturbed
repose, in the confidence that change might
as soon overwhelm the eternal world, as disturb this
inviolable sanctuary. She started to behold Albedir.
Without preface or remark, he recounted with eager
haste the occurrences of the day. Khaled’s tranquil
spirit could hardly keep pace with the breathless rapidity
of his narration. She was bewildered with staggering
wonder even to hear his confused tones, and behold his
agitated countenance.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p>On the following morning Albedir arose at sunrise, and
visited the stranger. He found him already risen, and
employed in adorning the lattice of his chamber with
flowers from the garden. There was something in his
attitude and occupation singularly expressive of his entire
familiarity with the scene. Albedir’s habitation seemed
to have been his accustomed home. He addressed his
host in a tone of gay and affectionate welcome, such as
never fails to communicate by sympathy the feelings
from which it flows.</p>

<p>“My friend,” said he, “the balm of the dew of our
vale is sweet; or is this garden the favoured spot where
the winds conspire to scatter the best odours they can
find? Come, lend me your arm awhile, I feel very<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
weak.” He motioned to walk forth, but, as if unable to
proceed, rested on the seat beside the door. For a few
moments they were silent, if the interchange of cheerful
and happy looks is to be called silence. At last he
observed a spade that rested against the wall. “You
have only one spade, brother,” said he; “you have
only one, I suppose, of any of the instruments of tillage.
Your garden ground, too, occupies a certain space which
it will be necessary to enlarge. This must be quickly
remedied. I cannot earn my supper of to-night, nor of
to-morrow; but thenceforward, I do not mean to eat
the bread of idleness. I know that you would willingly
perform the additional labour which my nourishment
would require; I know, also, that you would feel a
degree of pleasure in the fatigue arising from this employment,
but I shall contest with you such pleasures
as these, and such pleasures as these alone.” His eyes
were somewhat wan, and the tone of his voice languid
as he spoke.</p>

<p>As they were thus engaged, Khaled came towards
them. The stranger beckoned to her to sit beside him,
and taking her hands within his own, looked attentively
on her mild countenance. Khaled inquired if he had
been refreshed by sleep. He replied by a laugh of
careless and inoffensive glee; and placing one of her
hands within Albedir’s, said, “If this be sleep, here in
this odorous vale, where these sweet smiles encompass
us, and the voices of those who love are heard&mdash;if these
be the visions of sleep, sister, those who lie down in
misery shall arise lighter than the butterflies. I came
from amid the tumult of a world, how different from
this! I am unexpectedly among you, in the midst of a
scene such as my imagination never dared to promise.
I must remain here&mdash;I must not depart.” Khaled,
recovering from the admiration and astonishment caused
by the stranger’s words and manner, assured him of the
happiness which she should feel in such an addition to<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
her society. Albedir, too, who had been more deeply
impressed than Khaled by the event of his arrival,
earnestly reassured him of the ardour of the affection
with which he had inspired them. The stranger smiled
gently to hear the unaccustomed fervour of sincerity
which animated their address, and was rising to retire,
when Khaled said, “You have not yet seen our children,
Maimuna and Abdallah. They are by the water-side,
playing with their favourite snake. We have only to
cross yonder little wood, and wind down a path cut in
the rock that overhangs the lake, and we shall find them
beside a recess which the shore makes there, and which
a chasm, as it were, among the rocks and woods, encloses.
Do you think you could walk there?” “To
see your children, Khaled? I think I could, with the
assistance of Albedir’s arm, and yours.”&mdash;So they went
through the wood of ancient cypress, intermingled with
the brightness of many-tinted blooms, which gleamed
like stars through its romantic glens. They crossed the
green meadow, and entered among the broken chasms,
beautiful as they were in their investiture of odoriferous
shrubs. They came at last, after pursuing a path which
wound through the intricacies of a little wilderness, to
the borders of the lake. They stood on the rock which
overhung it, from which there was a prospect of all the
miracles of nature and of art which encircled and
adorned its shores. The stranger gazed upon it with a
countenance unchanged by any emotion, but, as it were,
thoughtfully and contemplatingly. As he gazed, Khaled
ardently pressed his hand, and said, in a low yet eager
voice, “Look, look, lo there!” He turned towards her,
but her eyes were not on him. She looked below&mdash;her
lips were parted by the feelings which possessed her
soul&mdash;her breath came and went regularly but inaudibly.
She leaned over the precipice, and her dark hair hanging
beside her face, gave relief to its fine lineaments,
animated by such love as exceeds utterance. The<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
stranger followed her eyes, and saw that her children
were in the glen below; then raising his eyes, exchanged
with her affectionate looks of congratulation and delight.
The boy was apparently eight years old, the girl about
two years younger. The beauty of their form and
countenance was something so divine and strange, as
overwhelmed the senses of the beholder like a delightful
dream, with insupportable ravishment. They were
arrayed in a loose robe of linen, through which the
exquisite proportions of their form appeared. Unconscious
that they were observed, they did not relinquish
the occupation in which they were engaged. They had
constructed a little boat of the bark of trees, and had
given it sails of interwoven feathers, and launched it on
the water. They sat beside a white flat stone, on
which a small snake lay coiled, and when their work
was finished, they arose and called to the snake in
melodious tones, so that it understood their language.
For it unwreathed its shining circles and crept to the
boat, into which no sooner had it entered than the girl
loosened the band which held it to the shore, and it
sailed away. Then they ran round and round the little
creek, clapping their hands, and melodiously pouring out
wild sounds, which the snake seemed to answer by the
restless glancing of his neck. At last a breath of wind
came from the shore, and the boat changed its course,
and was about to leave the creek, which the snake perceived
and leaped into the water, and came to the little
children’s feet. The girl sang to it, and it leaped into
her bosom, and she crossed her fair hands over it, as if
to cherish it there. Then the boy answered with a song,
and it glided from beneath her hands and crept towards
him. While they were thus employed, Maimuna looked
up, and seeing her parents on the cliff, ran to meet them
up the steep path that wound around it; and Abdallah,
leaving his snake, followed joyfully.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ON_THE_PUNISHMENT_OF">ON THE PUNISHMENT OF
DEATH.</h2>

<p class="h2sub fantasy">A Fragment.</p>

<p class="dropcap-first-letter">The first law which it becomes a Reformer to propose
and support, at the approach of a period
of great political change, is the abolition of the
punishment of death.</p>

<p>It is sufficiently clear that revenge, retaliation, atonement,
expiation, are rules and motives, so far from
deserving a place in any enlightened system of political
life, that they are the chief sources of a prodigious class
of miseries in the domestic circles of society. It is clear
that however the spirit of legislation may appear to frame
institutions upon more philosophical maxims, it has
hitherto, in those cases which are termed criminal, done
little more than palliate the spirit, by gratifying a portion
of it; and afforded a compromise between that which is
best;&mdash;the inflicting of no evil upon a sensitive being,
without a decisively beneficial result in which he should
at least participate;&mdash;and that which is worst; that he
should be put to torture for the amusement of those
whom he may have injured, or may seem to have
injured.</p>

<p>Omitting these remoter considerations, let us inquire
what <i>Death</i> is; that which is applied as a measure of
transgressions of indefinite shades of distinction, so<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
soon as they shall have passed that degree and colour of
enormity, with which it is supposed no inferior infliction
is commensurate.</p>

<p>And first, whether death is good or evil, a punishment
or a reward, or whether it be wholly indifferent, no man
can take upon himself to assert. That that within us
which thinks and feels, continues to think and feel after
the dissolution of the body, has been the almost universal
opinion of mankind, and the accurate philosophy of what
I may be permitted to term the modern Academy, by
showing the prodigious depth and extent of our ignorance
respecting the causes and nature of sensation,
renders probable the affirmative of a proposition, the
negative of which it is so difficult to conceive, and the
popular arguments against which, derived from what is
called the atomic system, are proved to be applicable
only to the relation which one object bears to another,
as apprehended by the mind, and not to existence itself,
or the nature of that essence which is the medium and
receptacle of objects.</p>

<p>The popular system of religion suggests the idea that
the mind, after death, will be painfully or pleasurably
affected according to its determinations during life.
However ridiculous and pernicious we must admit the
vulgar accessories of this creed to be, there is a certain
analogy, not wholly absurd, between the consequences
resulting to an individual during life from the virtuous
or vicious, prudent or imprudent, conduct of his external
actions, to those consequences which are conjectured to
ensue from the discipline and order of his internal
thoughts, as affecting his condition in a future state.
They omit, indeed, to calculate upon the accidents of
disease, and temperament, and organisation, and circumstance,
together with the multitude of independent
agencies which affect the opinions, the conduct, and the
happiness of individuals, and produce determinations of
the will, and modify the judgment, so as to produce<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
effects the most opposite in natures considerably similar.
These are those operations in the order of the whole of
nature, tending, we are prone to believe, to some definite
mighty end, to which the agencies of our peculiar nature
are subordinate; nor is there any reason to suppose,
that in a future state they should become suddenly
exempt from that subordination. The philosopher is
unable to determine whether our existence in a previous
state has affected our present condition, and abstains
from deciding whether our present condition would affect
us in that which may be future. That, if we continue to
exist, the manner of our existence will be such as no inferences
nor conjectures, afforded by a consideration of our
earthly experience, can elucidate, is sufficiently obvious.
The opinion that the vital principle within us, in whatever
mode it may continue to exist, must lose that consciousness
of definite and individual being which now
characterises it, and become a unit in the vast sum
of action and of thought which disposes and animates
the universe, and is called God, seems to belong to
that class of opinion which has been designated as
indifferent.</p>

<p>To compel a person to know all that can be known by
the dead, concerning that which the living fear, hope, or
forget; to plunge him into the pleasure or pain which
there awaits him; to punish or reward him in a manner
and in a degree incalculable and incomprehensible by us;
to disrobe him at once from all that intertexture of good
and evil with which Nature seems to have clothed every
form of individual existence, is to inflict on him the doom
of death.</p>

<p>A certain degree of pain and terror usually accompany
the infliction of death. This degree is infinitely varied
by the infinite variety in the temperament and opinions
of the sufferers. As a measure of punishment, strictly
so considered, and as an exhibition, which, by its known
effects on the sensibility of the sufferer, is intended to<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
intimidate the spectators from incurring a similar liability,
it is singularly inadequate.</p>

<p>Firstly,&mdash;Persons of energetic character, in whom, as
in men who suffer for political crimes, there is a large
mixture of enterprise, and fortitude, and disinterestedness,
and the elements, though misguided and disarranged, by
which the strength and happiness of a nation might have
been cemented, die in such a manner, as to make death
appear not evil, but good. The death of what is called
a traitor, that is, a person who, from whatever motive,
would abolish the government of the day, is as often a
triumphant exhibition of suffering virtue, as the warning
of a culprit. The multitude, instead of departing with a
panic-stricken approbation of the laws which exhibited
such a spectacle, are inspired with pity, admiration and
sympathy; and the most generous among them feel an
emulation to be the authors of such flattering emotions,
as they experience stirring in their bosoms. Impressed
by what they see and feel, they make no distinction
between the motives which incited the criminals to the
actions for which they suffer, or the heroic courage with
which they turned into good that which their judges
awarded to them as evil, or the purpose itself of those
actions, though that purpose may happen to be eminently
pernicious. The laws in this case lose that sympathy,
which it ought to be their chief object to secure, and in
a participation of which, consists their chief strength in
maintaining those sanctions by which the parts of the
social union are bound together, so as to produce, as
nearly as possible, the ends for which it is instituted.</p>

<p>Secondly&mdash;persons of energetic character, in communities
not modelled with philosophical skill to turn
all the energies which they contain to the purposes of
common good, are prone also to fall into the temptation
of undertaking, and are peculiarly fitted for despising the
perils attendant upon consummating, the most enormous
crimes. Murder, rapes, extensive schemes of plunder,
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
are the actions of persons belonging to this class; and
death is the penalty of conviction. But the coarseness
of organisation, peculiar to men capable of committing
acts wholly selfish, is usually found to be associated with
a proportionate insensibility to fear or pain. Their
sufferings communicate to those of the spectators, who
may be liable to the commission of similar crimes, a sense
of the lightness of that event, when closely examined,
which at a distance, as uneducated persons are accustomed
to do, probably they regarded with horror. But
a great majority of the spectators are so bound up in the
interests and the habits of social union that no temptation
would be sufficiently strong to induce them to a
commission of the enormities to which this penalty is
assigned. The more powerful, the richer among them,&mdash;and
a numerous class of little tradesmen are richer
and more powerful than those who are employed by them,
and the employer, in general, bears this relation to the
employed,&mdash;regard their own wrongs as, in some degree,
avenged, and their own rights secured by this punishment,
inflicted as the penalty of whatever crime. In
cases of murder or mutilation, this feeling is almost
universal. In those, therefore, whom this exhibition
does not awaken to the sympathy which extenuates
crime and discredits the law which restrains it, it
produces feelings more directly at war with the genuine
purposes of political society. It excites those emotions
which it is the chief object of civilisation to extinguish
for ever, and in the extinction of which alone there can
be any hope of better institutions than those under which
men now misgovern one another. Men feel that their
revenge is gratified, and that their security is established,
by the extinction and the sufferings of beings, in most
respects resembling themselves; and their daily occupations
constraining them to a precise form in all their
thoughts, they come to connect inseparably the idea of
their own advantage with that of the death and torture<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
of others. It is manifest that the object of sane polity
is directly the reverse; and that laws founded upon
reason, should accustom the gross vulgar to associate
their ideas of security and of interest with the reformation,
and the strict restraint, for that purpose alone, of those
who might invade it.</p>

<p>The passion of revenge is originally nothing more
than an habitual perception of the ideas of the sufferings
of the person who inflicts an injury, as connected, as
they are in a savage state, or in such portions of society
as are yet undisciplined to civilisation, with security that
that injury will not be repeated in future. This feeling,
engrafted upon superstition and confirmed by habit, at
last loses sight of the only object for which it may be
supposed to have been implanted, and becomes a passion
and a duty to be pursued and fulfilled, even to the
destruction of those ends to which it originally tended.
The other passions, both good and evil, Avarice, Remorse,
Love, Patriotism, present a similar appearance;
and to this principle of the mind over-shooting the mark
at which it aims, we owe all that is eminently base or
excellent in human nature; in providing for the nutriment
or the extinction of which consists the true art of
the legislator.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>
<p>Nothing is more clear than that the infliction of
punishment in general, in a degree which the reformation
and the restraint of those who transgress the laws does
not render indispensable, and none more than death,
confirms all the inhuman and unsocial impulses of men.
It is almost a proverbial remark, that those nations in
which the penal code has been particularly mild, have
been distinguished from all others by the rarity of crime.
But the example is to be admitted to be equivocal. A
more decisive argument is afforded by a consideration of
the universal connexion of ferocity of manners, and a
contempt of social ties, with the contempt of human life.
Governments which derive their institutions from the
existence of circumstances of barbarism and violence,
with some rare exceptions perhaps, are bloody in proportion
as they are despotic, and form the manners of
their subjects to a sympathy with their own spirit.</p>

<p>The spectators who feel no abhorrence at a public
execution, but rather a self-applauding superiority, and
a sense of gratified indignation, are surely excited to the
most inauspicious emotions. The first reflection of such
a one is the sense of his own internal and actual worth,
as preferable to that of the victim, whom circumstances
have led to destruction. The meanest wretch is impressed
with a sense of his own comparative merit. He
is one of those on whom the tower of Siloam fell not&mdash;he
is such a one as Jesus found not in all Samaria, who,
in his own soul, throws the first stone at the woman
taken in adultery. The popular religion of the country
takes its designation from that illustrious person whose
beautiful sentiment I have quoted. Any one who has
stript from the doctrines of this person the veil of
familiarity, will perceive how adverse their spirit is to
feelings of this nature.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> The savage and the illiterate are but faintly aware of the distinction
between the future and the past; they make actions belonging
to periods so distinct, the subjects of similar feelings; they live only
in the present, or in the past as it is present. It is in this that the
philosopher excels one of the many; it is this which distinguishes
the doctrine of philosophic necessity from fatalism; and that determination
of the will, by which it is the active source of future events,
from that liberty or indifference, to which the abstract liability of
irremediable actions is attached, according to the notions of the
vulgar.</p>

<p>This is the source of the erroneous excesses of Remorse and
Revenge; the one extending itself over the future, and the other
over the past; provinces in which their suggestions can only be the
sources of evil. The purpose of a resolution to act more wisely and
virtuously in future, and the sense of a necessity of caution in repressing
an enemy, are the sources from which the enormous superstitions
implied in the words cited have arisen.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ON_LIFE">ON LIFE.</h2>

<p class="dropcap-first-letter">Life and the world, or whatever we call that which
we are and feel, is an astonishing thing. The
mist of familiarity obscures from us the wonder
of our being. We are struck with admiration at some
of its transient modifications, but it is itself the great
miracle. What are changes of empires, the wreck of
dynasties, with the opinions which supported them;
what is the birth and the extinction of religious and of
political systems, to life? What are the revolutions of
the globe which we inhabit, and the operations of the
elements of which it is composed, compared with life?
What is the universe of stars, and suns, of which this
inhabited earth is one, and their motions, and their
destiny, compared with life? Life, the great miracle,
we admire not, because it is so miraculous. It is well
that we are thus shielded by the familiarity of what is at
once so certain and so unfathomable, from an astonishment
which would otherwise absorb and overawe the
functions of that which is its object.</p>

<p>If any artist, I do not say had executed, but had
merely conceived in his mind the system of the sun, and
the stars, and planets, they not existing, and had painted
to us in words, or upon canvas, the spectacle now afforded
by the nightly cope of heaven, and illustrated it by the
wisdom of astronomy, great would be our admiration.
Or had he imagined the scenery of this earth, the<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
mountains, the seas, and the rivers; the grass, and the
flowers, and the variety of the forms and masses of the
leaves of the woods, and the colours which attend the
setting and the rising sun, and the hues of the atmosphere,
turbid or serene, these things not before existing,
truly we should have been astonished, and it would not
have been a vain boast to have said of such a man,
“Non merita nome di creatore, se non Iddio ed il
Poeta.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> But now these things are looked on with little
wonder, and to be conscious of them with intense delight
is esteemed to be the distinguishing mark of a refined and
extraordinary person. The multitude of men care not for
them. It is thus with Life&mdash;that which includes all.</p>

<p>What is life? Thoughts and feelings arise, with or
without our will, and we employ words to express them.
We are born, and our birth is unremembered, and our
infancy remembered but in fragments; we live on, and
in living we lose the apprehension of life. How vain is
it to think that words can penetrate the mystery of our
being! Rightly used they may make evident our ignorance
to ourselves; and this is much. For what are we?
Whence do we come? and whither do we go? Is birth
the commencement, is death the conclusion of our being?
What is birth and death?</p>

<p>The most refined abstractions of logic conduct to a
view of life, which, though startling to the apprehension,
is, in fact, that which the habitual sense of its repeated
combinations has extinguished in us. It strips, as it
were, the painted curtain from this scene of things. I
confess that I am one of those who am unable to refuse
my assent to the conclusions of those philosophers who
assert that nothing exists but as it is perceived.</p>

<p>It is a decision against which all our persuasions
struggle, and we must be long convicted before we can
be convinced that the solid universe of external things
is “such stuff as dreams are made of.” The shocking<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
absurdities of the popular philosophy of mind and matter,
its fatal consequences in morals, and their violent dogmatism
concerning the source of all things, had early conducted
me to materialism. This materialism is a seducing
system to young and superficial minds. It allows its
disciples to talk, and dispenses them from thinking.
But I was discontented with such a view of things as it
afforded; man is a being of high aspirations, “looking
both before and after,” whose “thoughts wander through
eternity,” disclaiming alliance with transience and decay;
incapable of imagining to himself annihilation; existing
but in the future and the past; being, not what he is,
but what he has been and shall be. Whatever may be
his true and final destination, there is a spirit within him
at enmity with nothingness and dissolution. This is the
character of all life and being. Each is at once the
centre and the circumference; the point to which all
things are referred, and the line in which all things are
contained. Such contemplations as these, materialism
and the popular philosophy of mind and matter alike forbid;
they are only consistent with the intellectual system.</p>

<p>It is absurd to enter into a long recapitulation of
arguments sufficiently familiar to those inquiring minds,
whom alone a writer on abstruse subjects can be conceived
to address. Perhaps the most clear and vigorous statement
of the intellectual system is to be found in Sir
William Drummond’s Academical Questions. After
such an exposition, it would be idle to translate into
other words what could only lose its energy and fitness
by the change. Examined point by point, and word by
word, the most discriminating intellects have been able
to discern no train of thoughts in the process of reasoning,
which does not conduct inevitably to the conclusion
which has been stated.</p>

<p>What follows from the admission? It establishes
no new truth, it gives us no additional insight into our
hidden nature, neither its action nor itself. Philosophy,<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
impatient as it may be to build, has much work yet
remaining as pioneer for the overgrowth of ages. It
makes one step towards this object; it destroys error,
and the roots of error. It leaves, what it is too often
the duty of the reformer in political and ethical questions
to leave, a vacancy. It reduces the mind to that freedom
in which it would have acted, but for the misuse of words
and signs, the instruments of its own creation. By signs,
I would be understood in a wide sense, including what
is properly meant by that term, and what I peculiarly
mean. In this latter sense, almost all familiar objects
are signs, standing, not for themselves, but for others, in
their capacity of suggesting one thought which shall lead
to a train of thoughts. Our whole life is thus an education
of error.</p>

<p>Let us recollect our sensations as children. What a
distinct and intense apprehension had we of the world
and of ourselves! Many of the circumstances of social
life were then important to us which are now no longer
so. But that is not the point of comparison on which
I mean to insist. We less habitually distinguished all
that we saw and felt, from ourselves. They seemed, as it
were, to constitute one mass. There are some persons
who, in this respect, are always children. Those who
are subject to the state called reverie, feel as if their
nature were dissolved into the surrounding universe, or
as if the surrounding universe were absorbed into their
being. They are conscious of no distinction. And
these are states which precede, or accompany, or follow
an unusually intense and vivid apprehension of life. As
men grow up this power commonly decays, and they
become mechanical and habitual agents. Thus feelings
and then reasonings are the combined result of a multitude
of entangled thoughts, and of a series of what are
called impressions, planted by reiteration.</p>

<p>The view of life presented by the most refined
deductions of the intellectual philosophy, is that of<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
unity. Nothing exists but as it is perceived. The
difference is merely nominal between those two classes
of thought, which are vulgarly distinguished by the
names of ideas and of external objects. Pursuing the
same thread of reasoning, the existence of distinct
individual minds, similar to that which is employed
in now questioning its own nature, is likewise found
to be a delusion. The words <i>I</i>, <i>you</i>, <i>they</i>, are not signs
of any actual difference subsisting between the assemblage
of thoughts thus indicated, but are merely marks
employed to denote the different modifications of the
one mind.</p>

<p>Let it not be supposed that this doctrine conducts to
the monstrous presumption that I, the person who now
write and think, am that one mind. I am but a portion
of it. The words <i>I</i>, and <i>you</i>, and <i>they</i> are grammatical
devices invented simply for arrangement, and totally
devoid of the intense and exclusive sense usually attached
to them. It is difficult to find terms adequate
to express so subtle a conception as that to which the
Intellectual Philosophy has conducted us. We are on
that verge where words abandon us, and what wonder
if we grow dizzy to look down the dark abyss of how
little we know!</p>

<p>The relations of <i>things</i> remain unchanged, by whatever
system. By the word <i>things</i> is to be understood
any object of thought, that is, any thought upon which
any other thought is employed, with an apprehension of
distinction. The relations of these remain unchanged;
and such is the material of our knowledge.</p>

<p>What is the cause of life? that is, how was it produced,
or what agencies distinct from life have acted or
act upon life? All recorded generations of mankind
have wearily busied themselves in inventing answers to
this question; and the result has been,&mdash;Religion. Yet,
that the basis of all things cannot be, as the popular
philosophy alleges, mind, is sufficiently evident. Mind,<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
as far as we have any experience of its properties, and
beyond that experience how vain is argument! cannot
create, it can only perceive. It is said also to be the
cause. But cause is only a word expressing a certain
state of the human mind with regard to the manner in
which two thoughts are apprehended to be related to
each other. If any one desires to know how unsatisfactorily
the popular philosophy employs itself upon this
great question, they need only impartially reflect upon
the manner in which thoughts develop themselves in
their minds. It is infinitely improbable that the cause
of mind, that is, of existence, is similar to mind.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ON_A_FUTURE_STATE">ON A FUTURE STATE.</h2>

<p class="dropcap-first-letter">It has been the persuasion of an immense majority
of human beings in all ages and nations that
we continue to live after death,&mdash;that apparent
termination of all the functions of sensitive and intellectual
existence. Nor has mankind been contented
with supposing that species of existence which some
philosophers have asserted; namely, the resolution of
the component parts of the mechanism of a living being
into its elements, and the impossibility of the minutest
particle of these sustaining the smallest diminution.
They have clung to the idea that sensibility and thought,
which they have distinguished from the objects of it,
under the several names of spirit and matter, is, in its
own nature, less susceptible of division and decay, and
that, when the body is resolved into its elements, the
principle which animated it will remain perpetual and
unchanged. Some philosophers&mdash;and those to whom
we are indebted for the most stupendous discoveries in
physical science, suppose, on the other hand, that intelligence
is the mere result of certain combinations
among the particles of its objects; and those among
them who believe that we live after death, recur to the
interposition of a supernatural power, which shall overcome
the tendency inherent in all material combinations,
to dissipate and be absorbed into other forms.</p>

<p>Let us trace the reasonings which in one and the
other have conducted to these two opinions, and endeavour<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
to discover what we ought to think on a question
of such momentous interest. Let us analyse the ideas
and feelings which constitute the contending beliefs,
and watchfully establish a discrimination between words
and thoughts. Let us bring the question to the test of
experience and fact; and ask ourselves, considering our
nature in its entire extent, what light we derive from
a sustained and comprehensive view of its component
parts, which may enable us to assert, with certainty, that
we do or do not live after death.</p>

<p>The examination of this subject requires that it should
be stript of all those accessory topics which adhere to
it in the common opinion of men. The existence of a
God, and a future state of rewards and punishments, are
totally foreign to the subject. If it be proved that the
world is ruled by a Divine Power, no inference necessarily
can be drawn from that circumstance in favour
of a future state. It has been asserted, indeed, that as
goodness and justice are to be numbered among the
attributes of the Deity, he will undoubtedly compensate
the virtuous who suffer during life, and that he will
make every sensitive being, who does not deserve
punishment, happy for ever. But this view of the
subject, which it would be tedious as well as superfluous
to develop and expose, satisfies no person, and cuts
the knot which we now seek to untie. Moreover,
should it be proved, on the other hand, that the mysterious
principle which regulates the proceedings of the
universe, is neither intelligent nor sensitive, yet it is not an
inconsistency to suppose at the same time, that the animating
power survives the body which it has animated,
by laws as independent of any supernatural agent as
those through which it first became united with it. Nor,
if a future state be clearly proved, does it follow that
it will be a state of punishment or reward.</p>

<p>By the word death, we express that condition in
which natures resembling ourselves apparently cease to<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
be that which they were. We no longer hear them
speak, nor see them move. If they have sensations
and apprehensions, we no longer participate in them.
We know no more than that those external organs, and
all that fine texture of material frame, without which
we have no experience that life or thought can subsist,
are dissolved and scattered abroad. The body is placed
under the earth, and after a certain period there remains
no vestige even of its form. This is that contemplation
of inexhaustible melancholy, whose shadow eclipses the
brightness of the world. The common observer is struck
with dejection of the spectacle. He contends in vain
against the persuasion of the grave, that the dead indeed
cease to be. The corpse at his feet is prophetic of his
own destiny. Those who have preceded him, and
whose voice was delightful to his ear; whose touch met
his like sweet and subtle fire; whose aspect spread a
visionary light upon his path&mdash;these he cannot meet
again. The organs of sense are destroyed, and the intellectual
operations dependent on them have perished
with their sources. How can a corpse see or feel? its
eyes are eaten out, and its heart is black and without
motion. What intercourse can two heaps of putrid clay
and crumbling bones hold together? When you can
discover where the fresh colours of the faded flower
abide, or the music of the broken lyre, seek life among
the dead. Such are the anxious and fearful contemplations
of the common observer, though the popular
religion often prevents him from confessing them even
to himself.</p>

<p>The natural philosopher, in addition to the sensations
common to all men inspired by the event of death, believes
that he sees with more certainty that it is attended
with the annihilation of sentiment and thought. He
observes the mental powers increase and fade with
those of the body, and even accommodate themselves
to the most transitory changes of our physical nature.<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
Sleep suspends many of the faculties of the vital and
intellectual principle; drunkenness and disease will
either temporarily or permanently derange them. Madness
or idiotcy may utterly extinguish the most excellent
and delicate of those powers. In old age the mind
gradually withers; and as it grew and was strengthened
with the body, so does it together with the body sink
into decrepitude. Assuredly these are convincing evidences
that so soon as the organs of the body are
subjected to the laws of inanimate matter, sensation,
and perception, and apprehension, are at an end. It is
probable that what we call thought is not an actual
being, but no more than the relation between certain
parts of that infinitely varied mass, of which the rest of
the universe is composed, and which ceases to exist so
soon as those parts change their position with regard to
each other. Thus colour, and sound, and taste, and odour
exist only relatively. But let thought be considered as
some peculiar substance, which permeates, and is the
cause of, the animation of living beings. Why should
that substance be assumed to be something essentially
distinct from all others, and exempt from subjection to
those laws from which no other substance is exempt?
It differs, indeed, from all other substances, as electricity,
and light, and magnetism, and the constituent parts
of air and earth, severally differ from all others. Each
of these is subject to change and to decay, and to conversion
into other forms. Yet the difference between
light and earth is scarcely greater than that which exists
between life, or thought, and fire. The difference between
the two former was never alleged as an argument
for the eternal permanence of either, in that form under
which they first might offer themselves to our notice.
Why should the difference between the two latter substances
be an argument for the prolongation of the
existence of one and not the other, when the existence
of both has arrived at their apparent termination? To<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
say that fire exists without manifesting any of the properties
of fire, such as light, heat, &amp;c., or that the principle
of life exists without consciousness, or memory, or desire,
or motive, is to resign, by an awkward distortion of
language, the affirmative of the dispute. To say that
the principle of life <i>may</i> exist in distribution among
various forms, is to assert what cannot be proved to be
either true or false, but which, were it true, annihilates
all hope of existence after death, in any sense in which
that event can belong to the hopes and fears of men.
Suppose, however, that the intellectual and vital principle
differs in the most marked and essential manner
from all other known substances; that they have all
some resemblance between themselves which it in no
degree participates. In what manner can this concession
be made an argument for its imperishability? All that
we see or know perishes and is changed. Life and
thought differ indeed from everything else. But that it
survives that period, beyond which we have no experience
of its existence, such distinction and dissimilarity affords
no shadow of proof, and nothing but our own desires
could have led us to conjecture or imagine.</p>

<p>Have we existed before birth? It is difficult to conceive
the possibility of this. There is, in the generative
principle of each animal and plant, a power which converts
the substances by which it is surrounded into a
substance homogeneous with itself. That is, the relation
between certain elementary particles of matter undergo
a change, and submit to new combinations. For when
we use the words <i>principle</i>, <i>power</i>, <i>cause</i>, &amp;c., we mean
to express no real being, but only to class under those
terms a certain series of co-existing phenomena; but let
it be supposed that this principle is a certain substance
which escapes the observation of the chemist and anatomist.
It certainly <i>may be</i>; though it is sufficiently
unphilosophical to allege the possibility of an opinion
as a proof of its truth. Does it see, hear, feel, before<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
its combination with those organs on which sensation
depends? Does it reason, imagine, apprehend, without
those ideas which sensation alone can communicate?
If we have not existed before birth; if, at the period
when the parts of our nature on which thought and life
depend, seem to be woven together, they are woven
together; if there are no reasons to suppose that we
have existed before that period at which our existence
apparently commences, then there are no grounds for
supposition that we shall continue to exist after our
existence has apparently ceased. So far as thought and
life is concerned, the same will take place with regard
to us, individually considered, after death, as had place
before our birth.</p>

<p>It is said that it is possible that we should continue
to exist in some mode totally inconceivable to us at
present. This is a most unreasonable presumption. It
casts on the adherents of annihilation the burthen of
proving the negative of a question, the affirmative of
which is not supported by a single argument, and which,
by its very nature, lies beyond the experience of the human
understanding. It is sufficiently easy, indeed, to form
any proposition, concerning which we are ignorant, just
not so absurd as not to be contradictory in itself, and
defy refutation. The possibility of whatever enters into
the wildest imagination to conceive is thus triumphantly
vindicated. But it is enough that such assertions should
be either contradictory to the known laws of nature, or
exceed the limits of our experience, that their fallacy or
irrelevancy to our consideration should be demonstrated.
They persuade, indeed, only those who desire to be persuaded.</p>

<p>This desire to be for ever as we are; the reluctance
to a violent and unexperienced change, which is common
to all the animated and inanimate combinations of the
universe, is, indeed, the secret persuasion which has
given birth to the opinions of a future state.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SPECULATIONS_ON_METAPHYSICS">SPECULATIONS ON METAPHYSICS.</h2>

<h3 id="THE_MIND">I. THE MIND.</h3>

<p>I. It is an axiom in mental philosophy, that we
can think of nothing which we have not perceived.
When I say that we can think of
nothing, I mean, we can imagine nothing, we can reason
of noticing, we can remember nothing, we can foresee
nothing. The most astonishing combinations of poetry,
the subtlest deductions of logic and mathematics, are no
other than combinations which the intellect makes of
sensations according to its own laws. A catalogue of
all the thoughts of the mind, and of all their possible
modifications, is a cyclopædic history of the universe.</p>

<p>But, it will be objected, the inhabitants of the various
planets of this and other solar systems; and the existence
of a Power bearing the same relation to all that we
perceive and are, as what we call a cause does to what
we call effect, were never subjects of sensation, and yet
the laws of mind almost universally suggest, according
to the various disposition of each, a conjecture, a persuasion,
or a conviction of their existence. The reply is
simple; these thoughts are also to be included in the
catalogue of existence; they are modes in which thoughts
are combined; the objection only adds force to the conclusion,
that beyond the limits of perception and thought
nothing can exist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>Thoughts, or ideas, or notions, call them what you
will, differ from each other, not in kind, but in force.
It has commonly been supposed that those distinct
thoughts which affect a number of persons, at regular
intervals, during the passage of a multitude of other
thoughts, which are called <i>real</i>, or <i>external objects</i>, are
totally different in kind from those which affect only a
few persons, and which recur at irregular intervals, and
are usually more obscure and indistinct, such as hallucinations,
dreams, and the ideas of madness. No essential
distinction between any one of these ideas, or any class
of them, is founded on a correct observation of the
nature of things, but merely on a consideration of what
thoughts are most invariably subservient to the security
and happiness of life; and if nothing more were expressed
by the distinction, the philosopher might safely
accommodate his language to that of the vulgar. But
they pretend to assert an essential difference, which has
no foundation in truth, and which suggests a narrow and
false conception of universal nature, the parent of the
most fatal errors in speculation. A specific difference
between every thought of the mind is, indeed, a necessary
consequence of that law by which it perceives
diversity and number; but a generic and essential
difference is wholly arbitrary. The principle of the
agreement and similarity of all thoughts, is, that they
are all thoughts; the principle of their disagreement
consists in the variety and irregularity of the occasions
on which they arise in the mind. That in which they
agree, to that in which they differ, is as everything to
nothing. Important distinctions, of various degrees of
force, indeed, are to be established between them, if
they were, as they may be, subjects of ethical and
œconomical discussion; but that is a question altogether
distinct.</p>

<p>By considering all knowledge as bounded by perception,
whose operations may be indefinitely combined,
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
we arrive at a conception of Nature inexpressibly more
magnificent, simple and true, than accords with the
ordinary systems of complicated and partial consideration.
Nor does a contemplation of the universe, in this
comprehensive and synthetical view, exclude the subtlest
analysis of its modifications and parts.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>A scale might be formed, graduated according to the
decrees of a combined ratio of intensity, duration, connexion,
periods of recurrence, and utility, which would
be the standard, according to which all ideas might be
measured, and an uninterrupted chain of nicely shadowed
distinctions would be observed, from the faintest impression
on the senses, to the most distinct combination of
those impressions; from the simplest of those combinations,
to that mass of knowledge which, including our
own nature, constitutes what we call the universe.</p>
</div>

<p>We are intuitively conscious of our own existence,
and of that connexion in the train of our successive
ideas, which we term our identity. We are conscious
also of the existence of other minds; but not intuitively.
Our evidence, with respect to the existence of other
minds, is founded upon a very complicated relation of
ideas, which it is foreign to the purpose of this treatise
to anatomise. The basis of this relation is, undoubtedly,
a periodical recurrence of masses of ideas, which our
voluntary determinations have, in one peculiar direction,
no power to circumscribe or to arrest, and against the
recurrence of which they can only imperfectly provide.
The irresistible laws of thought constrain us to believe
that the precise limits of our actual ideas are not the
actual limits of possible ideas; the law, according to
which these deductions are drawn, is called analogy;
and this is the foundation of all our inferences, from one
idea to another, inasmuch as they resemble each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>We see trees, houses, fields, living beings in our own
shape, and in shapes more or less analogous to our own.
These are perpetually changing the mode of their existence
relatively to us. To express the varieties of these
modes, we say, <i>we move</i>, <i>they move</i>; and as this motion
is continual, though not uniform, we express our conception
of the diversities of its course by&mdash;<i>it has been</i>, <i>it is</i>,
<i>it shall be</i>. These diversities are events or objects, and
are essential, considered relatively to human identity,
for the existence of the human mind. For if the
inequalities, produced by what has been termed the
operations of the external universe, were levelled by
the perception of our being, uniting, and filling up their
interstices, motion and mensuration, and time, and space;
the elements of the human mind being thus abstracted,
sensation and imagination cease. Mind cannot be considered
pure.</p>

<h4 id="WHAT_METAPHYSICS">I.&mdash;WHAT METAPHYSICS ARE. ERRORS IN THE USUAL
METHODS OF CONSIDERING THEM.</h4>

<p>We do not attend sufficiently to what passes within
ourselves. We combine words, combined a thousand
times before. In our minds we assume entire opinions;
and in the expression of those opinions, entire phrases,
when we would philosophise. Our whole style of expression
and sentiment is infected with the tritest plagiarisms.
Our words are dead, our thoughts are cold and borrowed.</p>

<p>Let us contemplate facts; let us, in the great study
of ourselves, resolutely compel the mind to a rigid consideration
of itself. We are not content with conjecture,
and inductions, and syllogisms, in sciences regarding
external objects. As in these, let us also, in considering
the phenomena of mind, severely collect those facts which
cannot be disputed. Metaphysics will thus possess this
conspicuous advantage over every other science, that<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
each student, by attentively referring to his own mind,
may ascertain the authorities, upon which any assertions
regarding it are supported. There can thus be no deception,
we ourselves being the depositaries of the evidence
of the subject which we consider.</p>

<p>Metaphysics may be defined as an inquiry concerning
those things belonging to, or connected with, the internal
nature of man.</p>

<p>It is said that mind produces motion; and it might
as well have been said, that motion produces mind.</p>

<h4 id="DIFFICULTY">II.&mdash;DIFFICULTY OF ANALYSING THE HUMAN MIND.</h4>

<p>If it were possible that a person should give a faithful
history of his being, from the earliest epochs of his
recollection, a picture would be presented such as the
world has never contemplated before. A mirror would
be held up to all men in which they might behold their
own recollections, and, in dim perspective, their shadowy
hopes and fears,&mdash;all that they dare not, or that daring
and desiring, they could not expose to the open eyes of
day. But thought can with difficulty visit the intricate
and winding chambers which it inhabits. It is like a
river whose rapid and perpetual stream flows outwards;&mdash;like
one in dread who speeds through the recesses
of some haunted pile, and dares not look behind. The
caverns of the mind are obscure, and shadowy; or pervaded
with a lustre, beautifully bright indeed, but shining
not beyond their portals. If it were possible to be where
we have been, vitally and indeed&mdash;if, at the moment of
our presence there, we could define the results of our
experience,&mdash;if the passage from sensation to reflection&mdash;from
a state of passive perception to voluntary contemplation,
were not so dizzying and so tumultuous, this
attempt would be less difficult.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<h4 id="HOW_ANALYSIS">III.&mdash;HOW THE ANALYSIS SHOULD BE CARRIED ON.</h4>

<p>Most of the errors of philosophers have arisen from
considering the human being in a point of view too
detailed and circumscribed. He is not a moral, and an
intellectual,&mdash;but also, and pre-eminently, an imaginative
being. His own mind is his law; his own mind is all
things to him. If we would arrive at any knowledge
which should be serviceable from the practical conclusions
to which it leads, we ought to consider the
mind of man and the universe as the great whole on
which to exercise our speculations. Here, above all,
verbal disputes ought to be laid aside, though this
has long been their chosen field of battle. It imports
little to inquire whether thought be distinct from the
objects of thought. The use of the words <i>external</i>
and <i>internal</i>, as applied to the establishment of this
distinction, has been the symbol and the source of
much dispute. This is merely an affair of words, and
as the dispute deserves, to say, that when speaking of
the objects of thought, we indeed only describe one
of the forms of thought&mdash;or that, speaking of thought,
we only apprehend one of the operations of the universal
system of beings.</p>

<h4 id="CATALOGUE">IV.&mdash;CATALOGUE OF THE PHENOMENA OF DREAMS, AS
CONNECTING SLEEPING AND WAKING.</h4>

<p>I. Let us reflect on our infancy, and give as faithfully
as possible a relation of the events of sleep.</p>

<p>And first I am bound to present a faithful picture of
my own peculiar nature relatively to sleep. I do not
doubt that were every individual to imitate me, it would
be found that among many circumstances peculiar to
their individual nature, a sufficiently general resemblance<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
would be found to prove the connexion existing between
those peculiarities and the most universal phenomena.
I shall employ caution, indeed, as to the facts which I
state, that they contain nothing false or exaggerated.
But they contain no more than certain elucidations of my
own nature; concerning the degree in which it resembles,
or differs from, that of others, I am by no means accurately
aware. It is sufficient, however, to caution the
reader against drawing general inferences from particular
instances.</p>

<p>I omit the general instances of delusion in fever or
delirium, as well as mere dreams considered in themselves.
A delineation of this subject, however inexhaustible
and interesting, is to be passed over.</p>

<p>What is the connexion of sleeping and of waking?</p>

<p>II. I distinctly remember dreaming three several
times, between intervals of two or more years, the same
precise dream. It was not so much what is ordinarily
called a dream; the single image, unconnected with all
other images, of a youth who was educated at the same
school with myself, presented itself in sleep. Even now,
after the lapse of many years, I can never hear the name
of this youth, without the three places where I dreamed
of him presenting themselves distinctly to my mind.</p>

<p>III. In dreams, images acquire associations peculiar
to dreaming; so that the idea of a particular house,
when it recurs a second time in dreams, will have relation
with the idea of the same house, in the first time,
of a nature entirely different from that which the house
excites, when seen or thought of in relation to waking
ideas.</p>

<p>IV. I have beheld scenes, with the intimate and unaccountable
connexion of which with the obscure parts
of my own nature, I have been irresistibly impressed.
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
I have beheld a scene which has produced no unusual
effect on my thoughts. After the lapse of many years
I have dreamed of this scene. It has hung on my
memory, it has haunted my thoughts, at intervals, with
the pertinacity of an object connected with human affections.
I have visited this scene again. Neither the
dream could be dissociated from the landscape, nor the
landscape from the dream, nor feelings, such as neither
singly could have awakened, from both. But the most
remarkable event of this nature, which ever occurred to
me, happened five years ago at Oxford. I was walking
with a friend, in the neighbourhood of that city, engaged
in earnest and interesting conversation. We suddenly
turned the corner of a lane, and the view, which its high
banks and hedges had concealed, presented itself. The
view consisted of a windmill, standing in one among
many plashy meadows, inclosed with stone walls; the
irregular and broken ground, between the wall and the
road on which we stood; a long low hill behind the
windmill, and a grey covering of uniform cloud spread
over the evening sky. It was that season when the last
leaf had just fallen from the scant and stunted ash. The
scene surely was a common scene; the season and the
hour little calculated to kindle lawless thought; it was a
tame uninteresting assemblage of objects, such as would
drive the imagination for refuge in serious and sober
talk, to the evening fireside, and the dessert of winter
fruits and wine. The effect which it produced on me
was not such as could have been expected. I suddenly
remembered to have seen that exact scene in some
dream of long<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="footnote">

remark closes this fragment, which was written in 1815. I
remember well his coming to me from writing it, pale and agitated,
to seek refuge in conversation from the fearful emotions it excited.&mdash;[<i>Note

<h3 id="SPECULATIONS_ON_MORALS">SPECULATIONS ON MORALS.</h3>

<h4 id="PLAN">I.&mdash;PLAN OF A TREATISE ON MORALS.</h4>

<p class="dropcap-first-letter">That great science which regards nature and the
operations of the human mind, is popularly
divided into Morals and Metaphysics. The
latter relates to a just classification, and the assignment
of distinct names to its ideas; the former regards simply
the determination of that arrangement of them which
produces the greatest and most solid happiness. It is
admitted that a virtuous or moral action is that action
which, when considered in all its accessories and consequences,
is fitted to produce the highest pleasure to
the greatest number of sensitive beings. The laws according
to which all pleasure, since it cannot be equally
felt by all sensitive beings, ought to be distributed by a
voluntary agent, are reserved for a separate chapter.</p>

<p>The design of this little treatise is restricted to the
development of the elementary principles of morals. As
far as regards that purpose, metaphysical science will be
treated merely so far as a source of negative truth; whilst
morality will be considered as a science, respecting which
we can arrive at positive conclusions.</p>

<p>The misguided imaginations of men have rendered
the ascertaining of what <i>is not true</i>, the principal direct<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
service which metaphysical science can bestow upon
moral science. Moral science itself is the doctrine of the
voluntary actions of man, as a sentient and social being.
These actions depend on the thoughts in his mind. But
there is a mass of popular opinion, from which the most
enlightened persons are seldom wholly free, into the truth
or falsehood of which it is incumbent on us to inquire,
before we can arrive at any firm conclusions as to the
conduct which we ought to pursue in the regulation of
our own minds, or towards our fellow-beings; or before
we can ascertain the elementary laws, according to which
these thoughts, from which these actions flow, are
originally combined.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The object of the forms according to which human
society is administered, is the happiness of the individuals
composing the communities which they regard, and these
forms are perfect or imperfect in proportion to the degree
in which they promote this end.</p>

<p>This object is not merely the quantity of happiness
enjoyed by individuals as sensitive beings, but the mode
in which it should be distributed among them as social
beings. It is not enough, if such a coincidence can be
conceived as possible, that one person or class of persons
should enjoy the highest happiness, whilst another is
suffering a disproportionate degree of misery. It is
necessary that the happiness produced by the common
efforts, and preserved by the common care, should be
distributed according to the just claims of each individual;
if not, although the quantity produced should be the
same, the end of society would remain unfulfilled. The
object is in a compound proportion to the quantity of
happiness produced, and the correspondence of the mode
in which it is distributed, to the elementary feelings of
man as a social being.</p>

<p>The disposition in an individual to promote this object
is called virtue; and the two constituent parts of virtue,
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
benevolence and justice, are correlative with these two
great portions of the only true object of all voluntary
actions of a human being. Benevolence is the desire to
be the author of good, and justice the apprehension of
the manner in which good ought to be done.</p>

<p>Justice and benevolence result from the elementary
laws of the human mind.</p>

<small>ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE.</small></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="allsmcap">SECT.</span> I. General View of the Nature and Objects of Virtue.&mdash;2. The
Origin and Basis of Virtue, as founded on the Elementary Principles
of Mind.&mdash;3. The Laws which flow from the nature of Mind
regulating the application of those principles to human actions.&mdash;4. Virtue,
a possible attribute of man.</p>
</div>

<p>We exist in the midst of a multitude of beings like
ourselves, upon whose happiness most of our actions
exert some obvious and decisive influence.</p>

<p>The regulation of this influence is the object of moral
science.</p>

<p>We know that we are susceptible of receiving painful
or pleasurable impressions of greater or less intensity
and duration. That is called good which produces
pleasure; that is called evil which produces pain.
These are general names, applicable to every class of
causes, from which an over-balance of pain or pleasure
may result. But when a human being is the active
instrument of generating or diffusing happiness, the
principle through which it is most effectually instrumental
to that purpose, is called virtue. And benevolence,
or the desire to be the author of good, united
with justice, or an apprehension of the manner in which
that good is to be done, constitutes virtue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>But, wherefore should a man be benevolent and just?
The immediate emotions of his nature, especially in its
most inartificial state, prompt him to inflict pain, and to
arrogate dominion. He desires to heap superfluities to
his own store, although others perish with famine. He
is propelled to guard against the smallest invasion of his
own liberty, though he reduces others to a condition of
the most pitiless servitude. He is revengeful, proud, and
selfish. Wherefore should he curb these propensities?</p>

<p>It is inquired for what reason a human being should
engage in procuring the happiness, or refrain from producing
the pain of another? When a reason is required
to prove the necessity of adopting any system of conduct,
what is it that the objector demands? He requires
proof of that system of conduct being such as will most
effectually promote the happiness of mankind. To
demonstrate this, is to render a moral reason. Such is
the object of Virtue.</p>

<p>A common sophism, which, like many others, depends
on the abuse of a metaphorical expression to a literal
purpose, has produced much of the confusion which
has involved the theory of morals. It is said that no
person is bound to be just or kind, if, on his neglect,
he should fail to incur some penalty. Duty is obligation.
There can be no obligation without an obliger.
Virtue is a law, to which it is the will of the lawgiver
that we should conform; which will we should in no
manner be bound to obey, unless some dreadful punishment
were attached to disobedience. This is the philosophy
of slavery and superstition.</p>

<p>In fact, no person can be <i>bound</i> or <i>obliged</i>, without
some power preceding to bind and oblige. If I observe
a man bound hand and foot, I know that some one
bound him. But if I observe him returning self-satisfied
from the performance of some action, by which
he has been the willing author of extensive benefit,
I do not infer that the anticipation of hellish agonies,<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
or the hope of heavenly reward, has constrained him
to such an act.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It remains to be stated in what manner the sensations
which constitute the basis of virtue originate in
the human mind; what are the laws which it receives
there; how far the principles of mind allow it to be an
attribute of a human being; and, lastly, what is the
probability of persuading mankind to adopt it as a
universal and systematic motive of conduct.</p>

<h4 id="BENEVOLENCE">BENEVOLENCE.</h4>

<p>There is a class of emotions which we instinctively
avoid. A human being, such as is man considered
in his origin, a child a month old, has a very imperfect
consciousness of the existence of other natures resembling
itself. All the energies of its being are directed to
the extinction of the pains with which it is perpetually
assailed. At length it discovers that it is surrounded
by natures susceptible of sensations similar to its own.
It is very late before children attain to this knowledge.
If a child observes, without emotion, its nurse or its
mother suffering acute pain, it is attributable rather to
ignorance than insensibility. So soon as the accents
and gestures, significant of pain, are referred to the
feelings which they express, they awaken in the mind
of the beholder a desire that they should cease. Pain
is thus apprehended to be evil for its own sake, without
any other necessary reference to the mind by which its
existence is perceived, than such as is indispensable
to its perception. The tendencies of our original
sensations, indeed, all have for their object the preservation
of our individual being. But these are passive<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
and unconscious. In proportion as the mind acquires
an active power, the empire of these tendencies becomes
limited. Thus an infant, a savage, and a solitary
beast, is selfish, because its mind is incapable of
receiving an accurate intimation of the nature of pain
as existing in beings resembling itself. The inhabitant
of a highly civilised community will more acutely
sympathise with the sufferings and enjoyments of
others, than the inhabitant of a society of a less degree
of civilisation. He who shall have cultivated his intellectual
powers by familiarity with the highest specimens
of poetry and philosophy, will usually sympathise
more than one engaged in the less refined functions
of manual labour. Every one has experience of the
fact, that to sympathise with the sufferings of another,
is to enjoy a transitory oblivion of his own.</p>

<p>The mind thus acquires, by exercise, a habit, as
it were, of perceiving and abhorring evil, however
remote from the immediate sphere of sensations with
which that individual mind is conversant. Imagination
or mind employed in prophetically imaging forth its
objects, is that faculty of human nature on which every
gradation of its progress, nay, every, the minutest,
change, depends. Pain or pleasure, if subtly analysed,
will be found to consist entirely in prospect. The only
distinction between the selfish man and the virtuous
man is, that the imagination of the former is confined
within a narrow limit, whilst that of the latter embraces
a comprehensive circumference. In this sense, wisdom
and virtue may be said to be inseparable, and criteria
of each other. Selfishness is the offspring of ignorance
and mistake; it is the portion of unreflecting infancy,
and savage solitude, or of those whom toil or evil
occupations have blunted or rendered torpid; disinterested
benevolence is the product of a cultivated imagination,
and has an intimate connexion with all the arts
which add ornament, or dignity, or power, or stability<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
to the social state of man. Virtue is thus entirely a
refinement of civilised life; a creation of the human
mind; or, rather, a combination which it has made,
according to elementary rules contained within itself,
of the feelings suggested by the relations established
between man and man.</p>

<p>All the theories which have refined and exalted
humanity, or those which have been devised as alleviations
of its mistakes and evils, have been based upon the
elementary emotions of disinterestedness, which we feel
to constitute the majesty of our nature. Patriotism, as
it existed in the ancient republics, was never, as has
been supposed, a calculation of personal advantages.
When Mutius Scævola thrust his hand into the burning
coals, and Regulus returned to Carthage, and Epicharis
sustained the rack silently, in the torments of which she
knew that she would speedily perish, rather than betray
the conspirators to the tyrant;<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> these illustrious persons
certainly made a small estimate of their private interest.
If it be said that they sought posthumous fame;
instances are not wanting in history which prove that
men have even defied infamy for the sake of good.
But there is a great error in the world with respect to
the selfishness of fame. It is certainly possible that a
person should seek distinction as a medium of personal
gratification. But the love of fame is frequently no
more than a desire that the feelings of others should
confirm, illustrate, and sympathise with, our own. In
this respect it is allied with all that draws us out of
ourselves. It is the “last infirmity of noble minds.”
Chivalry was likewise founded on the theory of self-sacrifice.
Love possesses so extraordinary a power over
the human heart, only because disinterestedness is
united with the natural propensities. These propensities
themselves are comparatively impotent in cases where
the imagination of pleasure to be given, as well as to be<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
received, does not enter into the account. Let it not be
objected that patriotism, and chivalry, and sentimental
love, have been the fountains of enormous mischief.
They are cited only to establish the proposition that,
according to the elementary principles of mind, man is
capable of desiring and pursuing good for its own sake.</p>

<h4 id="JUSTICE">JUSTICE.</h4>

<p>The benevolent propensities are thus inherent in the
human mind. We are impelled to seek the happiness
of others. We experience a satisfaction in being the
authors of that happiness. Everything that lives is open
to impressions of pleasure and pain. We are led by
our benevolent propensities to regard every human being
indifferently with whom we come in contact. They
have preference only with respect to those who offer
themselves most obviously to our notice. Human
beings are indiscriminating and blind; they will avoid
inflicting pain, though that pain should be attended with
eventual benefit; they will seek to confer pleasure
without calculating the mischief that may result. They
benefit one at the expense of many.</p>

<p>There is a sentiment in the human mind that regulates
benevolence in its application as a principle of
action. This is the sense of justice. Justice, as well as
benevolence, is an elementary law of human nature. It
is through this principle that men are impelled to distribute
any means of pleasure which benevolence may
suggest the communication of to others, in equal portions
among an equal number of applications. If ten men
are shipwrecked on a desert island, they distribute
whatever subsistence may remain to them into equal
portions among themselves. If six of them conspire to
deprive the remaining four of their share, their conduct
is termed unjust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>The existence of pain has been shown to be a
circumstance which the human mind regards with dissatisfaction,
and of which it desires the cessation. It
is equally according to its nature to desire that the
advantages to be enjoyed by a limited number of persons
should be enjoyed equally by all. This proposition is
supported by the evidence of indisputable facts. Tell
some ungarbled tale of a number of persons being made
the victims of the enjoyments of one, and he who
would appeal in favour of any system which might
produce such an evil to the primary emotions of our
nature, would have nothing to reply. Let two persons,
equally strangers, make application for some benefit in
the possession of a third to bestow, and to which he
feels that they have an equal claim. They are both
sensitive beings; pleasure and pain affect them alike.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p>It is foreign to the general scope of this little treatise
to encumber a simple argument by controverting any of
the trite objections of habit or fanaticism. But there
are two; the first, the basis of all political mistake, and
the second, the prolific cause and effect of religious
error, which it seems useful to refute.</p>

<p>First, it is inquired, “Wherefore should a man be
benevolent and just?” The answer has been given in
the preceding chapter.</p>

<p>If a man persists to inquire why he ought to promote
the happiness of mankind, he demands a mathematical
or metaphysical reason for a moral action. The
absurdity of this scepticism is more apparent, but not
less real, than the exacting a moral reason for a mathematical
or metaphysical fact. If any person should
refuse to admit that all the radii of a circle are of equal<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
length, or that human actions are necessarily determined
by motives, until it could be proved that these radii and
these actions uniformly tended to the production of
the greatest general good, who would not wonder at the
unreasonable and capricious association of his ideas?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The writer of a philosophical treatise may, I imagine,
at this advanced era of human intellect, be held excused
from entering into a controversy with those reasoners,
if such there are, who would claim an exemption from its
decrees in favour of any one among those diversified
systems of obscure opinion respecting morals, which,
under the name of religions, have in various ages and
countries prevailed among mankind. Besides that if,
as these reasoners have pretended, eternal torture or
happiness will ensue as the consequence of certain
actions, we should be no nearer the possession of a
standard to determine what actions were right and wrong,
even if this pretended revelation, which is by no means
the case, had furnished us with a complete catalogue of
them. The character of actions as virtuous or vicious
would by no means be determined alone by the personal
advantage or disadvantage of each moral agent individually
considered. Indeed, an action is often
virtuous in proportion to the greatness of the personal
calamity which the author willingly draws upon himself
by daring to perform it. It is because an action
produces an overbalance of pleasure or pain to the
greatest number of sentient beings, and not merely
because its consequences are beneficial or injurious to
the author of that action, that it is good or evil. Nay,
this latter consideration has a tendency to pollute the
purity of virtue, inasmuch as it consists in the motive
rather than in the consequences of an action. A person
who should labour for the happiness of mankind lest
he should be tormented eternally in Hell, would with
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
reference to that motive possess as little claim to the
epithet of virtuous, as he who should torture, imprison,
and burn them alive, a more usual and natural consequence
of such principles, for the sake of the enjoyments
of Heaven.</p>

<p>My neighbour, presuming on his strength, may direct
me to perform or to refrain from a particular action;
indicating a certain arbitrary penalty in the event of
disobedience within his power to inflict. My action, if
modified by his menaces, can in no degree participate
in virtue. He has afforded me no criterion as to what
is right or wrong. A king, or an assembly of men, may
publish a proclamation affixing any penalty to any
particular action, but that is not immoral because such
penalty is affixed. Nothing is more evident than that
the epithet of virtue is inapplicable to the refraining from
that action on account of the evil arbitrarily attached to
it. If the action is in itself beneficial, virtue would rather
consist in not refraining from it, but in firmly defying
the personal consequences attached to its performance.</p>

<p>Some usurper of supernatural energy might subdue
the whole globe to his power; he might possess
new and unheard-of resources for induing his punishments
with the most terrible attributes of pain. The
torments of his victims might be intense in their degree,
and protracted to an infinite duration. Still the “will
of the lawgiver” would afford no surer criterion as to
what actions were right or wrong. It would only
increase the possible virtue of those who refuse to
become the instruments of his tyranny.</p>

<h4 id="MORAL_SCIENCE">II.&mdash;MORAL SCIENCE CONSISTS IN CONSIDERING THE
DIFFERENCE, NOT THE RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS.</h4>

<p>The internal influence, derived from the constitution
of the mind from which they flow, produces that peculiar<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
modification of actions, which makes them intrinsically
good or evil.</p>

<p>To attain an apprehension of the importance of this
distinction, let us visit, in imagination, the proceedings
of some metropolis. Consider the multitude of human
beings who inhabit it, and survey, in thought, the actions
of the several classes into which they are divided.
Their obvious actions are apparently uniform: the
stability of human society seems to be maintained
sufficiently by the uniformity of the conduct of its members,
both with regard to themselves and with regard
to others. The labourer arises at a certain hour, and
applies himself to the task enjoined him. The functionaries
of government and law are regularly employed in
their offices and courts. The trader holds a train of
conduct from which he never deviates. The ministers of
religion employ an accustomed language, and maintain a
decent and equable regard. The army is drawn forth, the
motions of every soldier are such as they were expected to
be; the general commands, and his words are echoed from
troop to troop. The domestic actions of men are, for the
most part, undistinguishable one from the other, at a
superficial glance. The actions which are classed under
the general appellation of marriage, education, friendship,
&amp;c., are perpetually going on, and to a superficial
glance, are similar one to the other.</p>

<p>But, if we would see the truth of things, they must be
stripped of this fallacious appearance of uniformity. In
truth, no one action has, when considered in its whole
extent, any essential resemblance with any other. Each
individual, who composes the vast multitude which we
have been contemplating, has a peculiar frame of mind,
which, whilst the features of the great mass of his actions
remain uniform, impresses the minuter lineaments with
its peculiar hues. Thus, whilst his life, as a whole, is
like the lives of other men, in detail it is most unlike;
and the more subdivided the actions become, that is,<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
the more they enter into that class which have a vital
influence on the happiness of others and his own, so
much the more are they distinct from those of other
men.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent8">“Those little nameless unremember’d acts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of kindness and of love,”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>as well as those deadly outrages which are inflicted by
a look, a word&mdash;or less&mdash;the very refraining from some
faint and most evanescent expression of countenance;
these flow from a profounder source than the series of
our habitual conduct, which, it has been already said,
derives its origin from without. These are the actions,
and such as these, which make human life what it is,
and are the fountains of all the good and evil with which
its entire surface is so widely and impartially overspread;
and though they are called minute, they are called so in
compliance with the blindness of those who cannot estimate
their importance. It is in the due appreciating the
general effects of their peculiarities, and in cultivating
the habit of acquiring decisive knowledge respecting the
tendencies arising out of them in particular cases, that
the most important part of moral science consists. The
deepest abyss of these vast and multitudinous caverns,
it is necessary that we should visit.</p>

<p>This is the difference between social and individual
man. Not that this distinction is to be considered
definite, or characteristic of one human being as compared
with another; it denotes rather two classes of
agency, common in a degree to every human being.
None is exempt, indeed, from that species of influence
which affects, as it were, the surface of his being, and
gives the specific outline to his conduct. Almost all
that is ostensible submits to that legislature created by
the general representation of the past feelings of mankind&mdash;imperfect
as it is from a variety of causes, as it
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
exists in the government, the religion, and domestic
habits. Those who do not nominally, yet actually,
submit to the same power. The external features of
their conduct, indeed, can no more escape it, than the
clouds can escape from the stream of the wind; and his
opinion, which he often hopes he has dispassionately
secured from all contagion of prejudice and vulgarity,
would be found, on examination, to be the inevitable
excrescence of the very usages from which he vehemently
dissents. Internally all is conducted otherwise;
the efficiency, the essence, the vitality of actions, derives
its colour from what is no ways contributed to from any
external source. Like the plant, which while it derives
the accident of its size and shape from the soil in which
it springs, and is cankered, or distorted, or inflated, yet
retains those qualities which essentially divide it from
all others; so that hemlock continues to be poison, and
the violet does not cease to emit its odour in whatever
soil it may grow.</p>

<p>We consider our own nature too superficially. We
look on all that in ourselves with which we can discover
a resemblance in others; and consider those resemblances
as the materials of moral knowledge. It is in
the differences that it actually consists.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="GHOST_STORIES">GHOST STORIES.</h2>

<p class="right">
<i>Geneva, Sunday, 18th August 1816.</i>
</p>

<p class="dropcap-first-letter">See Apollo’s Sexton,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> who tells us many mysteries
of his trade. We talk of Ghosts. Neither Lord
Byron nor M. G. L. seem to believe in them;
and they both agree, in the very face of reason, that none
could believe in ghosts without believing in God. I
do not think that all the persons who profess to discredit
these visitations, really discredit them; or, if they do in
the daylight, are not admonished by the approach of
loneliness and midnight, to think more respectfully of
the world of shadows.</p>

<p>Lewis recited a poem, which he had composed at
the request of the Princess of Wales. The Princess of
Wales, he premised, was not only a believer in ghosts,
but in magic and witchcraft, and asserted, that prophecies
made in her youth had been accomplished since. The
tale was of a lady in Germany.</p>

<p>This lady, Minna, had been exceedingly attached to<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
her husband, and they had made a vow that the one
who died first, should return after death to visit the
other as a ghost. She was sitting one day alone in her
chamber, when she heard an unusual sound of footsteps
on the stairs. The door opened, and her husband’s
spectre, gashed with a deep wound across the forehead,
and in military habiliments, entered. She appeared
startled at the apparition; and the ghost told her, that
when he should visit her in future, she would hear a
passing bell toll, and these words distinctly uttered close
to her ear, “Minna, I am here.” On inquiry, it was
found that her husband had fallen in battle on the very day
she was visited by the vision. The intercourse between
the ghost and the woman continued for some time, until
the latter laid aside all terror, and indulged herself in
the affection which she had felt for him while living.
One evening she went to a ball, and permitted her
thoughts to be alienated by the attentions of a Florentine
gentleman, more witty, more graceful, and more
gentle, as it appeared to her, than any person she had
ever seen. As he was conducting her through the dance,
a death bell tolled. Minna, lost in the fascination of
the Florentine’s attentions, disregarded, or did not hear
the sound. A second peal, louder and more deep,
startled the whole company, when Minna heard the
ghost’s accustomed whisper, and raising her eyes, saw
in an opposite mirror the reflection of the ghost, standing
over her. She is said to have died of terror.</p>

<p>Lewis told four other stories&mdash;all grim.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>A young man who had taken orders, had just been
presented with a living, on the death of the incumbent.
It was in the Catholic part of Germany. He arrived
at the parsonage on a Saturday night; it was summer,
and waking about three o’clock in the morning, and it<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
being broad day, he saw a venerable-looking man, but
with an aspect exceedingly melancholy, sitting at a desk
in the window, reading, and two beautiful boys standing
near him, whom he regarded with looks of the profoundest
grief. Presently he rose from his seat, the boys followed
him, and they were no more to be seen. The young
man, much troubled, arose, hesitating whether he should
regard what he had seen as a dream, or a waking
phantasy. To divert his dejection, he walked towards
the church, which the sexton was already employed in
preparing for the morning service. The first sight that
struck him was a portrait, the exact resemblance of the
man whom he had seen sitting in his chamber. It was
the custom in this district to place the portrait of each
minister, after his death, in the church.</p>

<p>He made the minutest inquiries respecting his predecessor,
and learned that he was universally beloved,
as a man of unexampled integrity and benevolence;
but that he was the prey of a secret and perpetual
sorrow. His grief was supposed to have arisen from
an attachment to a young lady, with whom his situation
did not permit him to unite himself. Others, however,
asserted, that a connexion did subsist between them,
and that even she occasionally brought to his house
two beautiful boys, the offspring of their connexion.&mdash;Nothing
further occurred until the cold weather came,
and the new minister desired a fire to be lighted in the
stove of the room where he slept. A hideous stench
arose from the stove as soon as it was lighted, and, on
examining it, the bones of two male children were found
within.</p>

<p>Lord Lyttelton and a number of his friends were
joined during the chase by a stranger. He was
excellently mounted, and displayed such courage, or,<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
rather so much desperate rashness, that no other person
in the hunt could follow him. The gentlemen, when
the chase was concluded, invited the stranger to dine
with them. His conversation was something of a
wonderful kind. He astonished, he interested, he
commanded the attention of the most inert. As night
came on, the company, being weary, began to retire one
by one, much later than the usual hour: the most
intellectual among them were retained latest by the
stranger’s fascination. As he perceived that they
began to depart, he redoubled his efforts to retain them.
At last, when few remained, he entreated them to stay
with him; but all pleaded the fatigue of a hard day’s
chase, and all at last retired. They had been in bed
about an hour, when they were awakened by the most
horrible screams, which issued from the stranger’s
room. Every one rushed towards it. The door was
locked. After a moment’s deliberation they burst it
open, and found the stranger stretched on the ground,
writhing with agony, and weltering in blood. On their
entrance he arose, and collecting himself, apparently
with a strong effort, entreated them to leave him&mdash;not
to disturb him, that he would give every possible explanation
in the morning. They complied. In the morning,
his chamber was found vacant, and he was seen no
more.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Miles Andrews, a friend of Lord Lyttelton, was
sitting one night alone when Lord Lyttelton came in,
and informed him that he was dead, and that this was
his ghost which he saw before him. Andrews pettishly
told him not to play any ridiculous tricks upon him, for
he was not in a temper to bear them. The ghost then
departed. In the morning Andrews asked his servant
at what hour Lord Lyttelton had arrived. The servant<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
said he did not know that he had arrived, but that he
would inquire. On inquiry it was found that Lord
Lyttelton had not arrived, nor had the door been opened
to any one during the whole night. Andrews sent to
Lord Lyttelton, and discovered, that he had died precisely
at the hour of the apparition.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>A gentleman on a visit to a friend who lived on the
skirts of an extensive forest in the east of Germany, lost
his way. He wandered for some hours among the
trees, when he saw a light at a distance. On approaching
it, he was surprised to observe, that it proceeded
from the interior of a ruined monastery. Before he
knocked he thought it prudent to look through the
window. He saw a multitude of cats assembled round
a small grave, four of whom were letting down a coffin
with a crown upon it. The gentleman, startled at this
unusual sight, and imagining that he had arrived among
the retreats of fiends or witches, mounted his horse and
rode away with the utmost precipitation. He arrived
at his friend’s house at a late hour, who had sat up for
him. On his arrival his friend questioned as to the
cause of the traces of trouble visible in his face. He
began to recount his adventure, after much difficulty,
knowing that it was scarcely possible that his friends
should give faith to his relation. No sooner had he
mentioned the coffin with a crown upon it, than his
friend’s cat, who seemed to have been lying asleep
before the fire, leaped up, saying&mdash;“Then I am the
King of the Cats!” and scrambled up the chimney, and
was seen no more.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thursday, 29th August.&mdash;We depart from Geneva,
at nine in the morning. The Swiss are very slow<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
drivers; besides which we have Jura to mount; we,
therefore, go a very few posts to-day. The scenery is
very beautiful, and we see many magnificent views.
We pass Les Rousses, which, when we crossed in the
spring, was deep in snow. We sleep at Morrez.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Friday, 30th.&mdash;We leave Morrez, and arrive in the
evening at Dole, after a various day.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Saturday, 31st.&mdash;From Dole we go to Rouvray, where
we sleep. We pass through Dijon; and, after Dijon,
take a different route than that which we followed on
the two other occasions. The scenery has some beauty
and singularity in the line of the mountains which surround
the Val de Suzon. Low, yet precipitous hills,
covered with vines or woods, and with streams, meadows,
and poplars, at the bottom.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Sunday, September 1st.&mdash;Leave Rouvray, pass
Auxerre, where we dine; a pretty town, and arrive, at
two o’clock, at Villeneuve le Guiard.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Monday, 2d.&mdash;From Villeneuve le Guiard, we arrive
at Fontainebleau. The scenery around this palace is
wild and even savage. The soil is full of rocks,
apparently granite, which on every side break through
the ground. The hills are low, but precipitous and
rough. The valleys, equally wild, are shaded by forests.
In the midst of this wilderness stands the palace. Some
of the apartments equal in magnificence anything that
I could conceive. The roofs are fretted with gold, and
the canopies of velvet. From Fontainebleau we proceed
to Versailles, in the route towards Rouen. We
arrive at Versailles at nine.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Tuesday, 3d.&mdash;We saw the palace and gardens of
Versailles and le Grand et Petit Trianon. They surpass<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
Fontainebleau. The gardens are full of statues,
vases, fountains, and colonnades. In all that essentially
belongs to a garden they are extraordinarily deficient.
The orangery is a stupid piece of expense. There was
one orange-tree, not apparently so old, sown in 1442.
We saw only the gardens and the theatre at the Petit
Trianon. The gardens are in the English taste, and
extremely pretty. The Grand Trianon was open. It
is a summer palace, light, yet magnificent. We were
unable to devote the time it deserved to the gallery of
paintings here. There was a portrait of Madame de la
Vallière, the repentant mistress of Louis XIV. She
was melancholy, but exceedingly beautiful, and was
represented as holding a skull, and sitting before a
crucifix, pale, and with downcast eyes.</p>

<p>We then went to the great palace. The apartments
are unfurnished, but even with this disadvantage, are
more magnificent than those of Fontainebleau. They
are lined with marble of various colours, whose pedestals
and capitals are gilt, and the ceiling is richly gilt with
compartments of painting. The arrangement of these
materials has in them, it is true, something effeminate
and royal. Could a Grecian architect have commanded
all the labour and money which was expended on
Versailles, he would have produced a fabric which the
whole world has never equalled. We saw the Hall of
Hercules, the balcony where the King and the Queen
exhibited themselves to the Parisian mob. The people
who showed us through the palace, obstinately refused
to say anything about the Revolution. We could not
even find out in which chamber the rioters of the 10th
August found the king. We saw the Salle d’Opera,
where are now preserved the portraits of the kings.
There was the race of the house of Orleans, with the
exception of Egalité, all extremely handsome. There
was Madame de Maintenon, and beside her a beautiful
little girl, the daughter of La Vallière. The pictures
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
had been hidden during the Revolution. We saw the
Library of Louis XVI. The librarian had held some
place in the ancient court near Marie Antoinette. He
returned with the Bourbons, and was waiting for some
better situation. He showed us a book which he had
preserved during the Revolution. It was a book of
paintings, representing a Tournament at the Court of
Louis XIV.; and it seemed that the present desolation
of France, the fury of the injured people, and all the
horrors to which they abandoned themselves, stung by
their long sufferings, flowed naturally enough from expenditures
so immense, as must have been demanded
by the magnificence of this tournament. The vacant
rooms of this palace imaged well the hollow show of
monarchy. After seeing these things we departed toward
Havre, and slept at Auxerre.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Wednesday, 4th.&mdash;We passed through Rouen, and
saw the cathedral, an immense specimen of the most
costly and magnificent gothic. The interior of the
church disappoints. We saw the burial-place of Richard
Cœur de Lion and his brother. The altar of the church
is a fine piece of marble. Sleep at Yvetot.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thursday, 5th.&mdash;We arrive at Havre, and wait for the
packet&mdash;wind contrary.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In a brief journal I kept at that time, I find a few pages in
Shelley’s handwriting, descriptive of the passage over the mountains
of Les Eschelles.&mdash;[<i>Note by Mrs. Shelley.</i>]</p>
</div>

<p>March 26, Thursday.&mdash;We travel towards the mountains,
and begin to enter the valleys of the Alps. The
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
country becomes covered again with verdure and cultivation,
and white chateaux and scattered cottages
among woods of old oak and walnut trees. The vines
are here peculiarly picturesque; they are trellised upon
immense stakes, and the trunks of them are moss-covered
and hoary with age. Unlike the French
vines, which creep lowly on the ground, they form
rows of interlaced bowers, which, when the leaves are
green and the red grapes are hanging among those
hoary branches, will afford a delightful shadow to those
who sit upon the moss underneath. The vines are
sometimes planted in the open fields, and sometimes
among lofty orchards of apple and pear-trees, the twigs
of which were just becoming purple with the bursting
blossoms.</p>

<p>We dined at Les Eschelles, a village at the foot of the
mountain of the same name, the boundaries of France
and Savoy. Before this we had been stopped at Pont
Bonvoisin, where the legal limits of the French and
Sardinian territories are placed. We here heard that a
Milanese had been sent back all the way to Lyons, because
his passport was unauthorised by the Sardinian
Consul, a few days before, and that we should be subjected
to the same treatment. We, in respect to the
character of our nation I suppose, were suffered to pass.
Our books, however, were, after a long discussion, sent
to Chambery, to be submitted to the censor; a priest,
who admits nothing of Rousseau, Voltaire, &amp;c., into the
dominions of the King of Sardinia. All such books are
burned.</p>

<p>After dinner we ascended Les Eschelles, winding
along a road, cut through perpendicular rocks, of immense
elevation, by Charles Emanuel, Duke of Savoy,
in 1582. The rocks, which cannot be less than a
thousand feet in perpendicular height, sometimes overhang
the road on each side, and almost shut out the
sky. The scene is like that described in the Prometheus
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
of Æschylus. Vast rifts and caverns in the granite
precipices, wintry mountains with ice and snow above;
the loud sounds of unseen waters within the caverns, and
walls of toppling rocks, only to be scaled as he describes,
by the winged chariot of the ocean nymphs.</p>

<p>Under the dominion of this tyranny, the inhabitants
of the fertile valleys, bounded by these mountains, are
in a state of most frightful poverty and disease. At the
foot of this ascent, were cut into the rocks at several
places, stories of the misery of the inhabitants, to move
the compassion of the traveller. One old man, lame
and blind, crawled out of a hole in the rock, wet with
the perpetual melting of the snows of above, and dripping
like a shower-bath.</p>

<p>The country, as we descended to Chambéry, continued
as beautiful; though marked with somewhat of a softer
character than before; we arrived a little after night-fall.</p>

reproof. The above stories have, some of them, appeared in print;
but, as a ghost story depends entirely on the mode in which it is

<p class="dropcap-first-letter">Behold us arrived at length at the end of our
journey&mdash;that is, within a few miles of it&mdash;because
we design to spend the summer on the
shore of the Lake of Como. Our journey was somewhat
painful from the cold&mdash;and in no other manner interesting
until we passed the Alps: of course I except the Alps
themselves; but no sooner had we arrived at Italy, than
the loveliness of the earth and the serenity of the sky
made the greatest difference in my sensations. I depend
on these things for life; for in the smoke of cities, and
the tumult of human kind, and the chilling fogs and
rain of our own country, I can hardly be said to live.
With what delight did I hear the woman, who conducted
us to see the triumphal arch of Augustus at Susa, speak
the clear and complete language of Italy, though half
unintelligible to me, after that nasal and abbreviated
cacophony of the French! A ruined arch of magnificent
proportions, in the Greek taste, standing in a kind of
road of green lawn, overgrown with violets and primroses,
and in the midst of stupendous mountains, and a
<i>blonde</i> woman, of light and graceful manners, something
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
in the style of Fuseli’s Eve, were the first things we met
in Italy.</p>

<p>This city is very agreeable. We went to the opera
last night&mdash;which is a most splendid exhibition. The
opera itself was not a favourite, and the singers very
inferior to our own. But the ballet, or rather a kind of
melodrame or pantomimic drama, was the most splendid
spectacle I ever saw. We have no Miss Melanie
here&mdash;in every other respect, Milan is unquestionably
superior. The manner in which language is translated
into gesture, the complete and full effect of the whole
as illustrating the history in question, the unaffected
self-possession of each of the actors, even to the children,
made this choral drama more impressive than I could
have conceived possible. The story is <i>Othello</i>, and
strange to say, it left no disagreeable impression.</p>

<p>I write, but I am not in the humour to write, and
you must expect longer, if not more entertaining, letters
soon&mdash;that is, in a week or so&mdash;when I am a little
recovered from my journey. Pray tell us all the news
with regard to our own offspring, whom we left at nurse
in England; as well as those of our friends. Mention
Cobbett and politics too&mdash;and Hunt&mdash;to whom Mary is
now writing&mdash;and particularly your own plans and yourself.
You shall hear more of me and my plans soon.
My health is improved already&mdash;and my spirits something&mdash;and
I have many literary schemes, and one in
particular&mdash;which I thirst to be settled that I may
begin. I have ordered Ollier to send you some sheets
&amp;c. for revision.</p>

<p>I had no conception that the distance between us,
measured by time in respect of letters, was so great. I
have but just received yours dated the 2d&mdash;and when
you will receive mine written from this city somewhat
later than the same date, I cannot know. I am sorry
to hear that you have been obliged to remain at Marlow;
a certain degree of society being almost a necessity of
life, particularly as we are not to see you this summer
in Italy. But this, I suppose, must be as it is. I often
revisit Marlow in thought. The curse of this life is,
that whatever is once known, can never be unknown.
You inhabit a spot, which before you inhabit it, is as
indifferent to you as any other spot upon earth, and
when, persuaded by some necessity, you think to leave
it, you leave it not; it clings to you&mdash;and with memories
of things, which, in your experience of them, gave no
such promise, revenges your desertion. Time flows on,
places are changed; friends who were with us, are no
longer with us; yet what has been seems yet to be, but
barren and stripped of life. See, I have sent you a
study for Nightmare Abbey.</p>

<p>Since I last wrote to you we have been to Como,
looking for a house. This lake exceeds any thing I
ever beheld in beauty, with the exception of the arbutus
islands of Killarney. It is long and narrow, and has
the appearance of a mighty river winding among the
mountains and the forests. We sailed from the town
of Como to a tract of country called the Tremezina, and
saw the various aspects presented by that part of the
lake. The mountains between Como and that village,
or rather cluster of villages, are covered on high with
chesnut forests (the eating chesnuts, on which the inhabitants
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
of the country subsist in time of scarcity),
which sometimes descend to the very verge of the lake,
overhanging it with their hoary branches. But usually
the immediate border of this shore is composed of laurel-trees,
and bay, and myrtle, and wild-fig trees, and olives,
which grow in the crevices of the rocks, and overhang
the caverns, and shadow the deep glens, which are
filled with the flashing light of the waterfalls. Other
flowering shrubs, which I cannot name, grow there also.
On high, the towers of village churches are seen white
among the dark forests. Beyond, on the opposite shore,
which faces the south, the mountains descend less precipitously
to the lake, and although they are much
higher, and some covered with perpetual snow, there
intervenes between them and the lake a range of lower
hills, which have glens and rifts opening to the other,
such as I should fancy the <i>abysses</i> of Ida or Parnassus.
Here are plantations of olive, and orange, and lemon-trees,
which are now so loaded with fruit, that there is
more fruit than leaves,&mdash;and vineyards. This shore
of the lake is one continued village, and the Milanese
nobility have their villas here. The union of culture
and the untameable profusion and loveliness of nature
is here so close, that the line where they are divided
can hardly be discovered. But the finest scenery is
that of the Villa Pliniana; so called from a fountain
which ebbs and flows every three hours, described by
the younger Pliny, which is in the court-yard. This
house, which was once a magnificent palace, and is now
half in ruins, we are endeavouring to procure. It is
built upon terraces <i>raised from</i> the bottom of the lake,
together with its garden, at the foot of a semi-circular
precipice, overshadowed by profound forests of chesnut.
The scene from the colonnade is the most extraordinary,
at once, and the most lovely that eye ever beheld. On
one side is the mountain, and immediately over you
are clusters of cypress-trees of an astonishing height,<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
which seem to pierce the sky. Above you, from among
the clouds, as it were, descends a waterfall of immense
size, broken by the woody rocks into a thousand channels
to the lake. On the other side is seen the blue extent
of the lake and the mountains, speckled with sails and
spires. The apartments of the Pliniana are immensely
large, but ill furnished and antique. The terraces,
which overlook the lake, and conduct under the shade
of such immense laurel-trees as deserve the epithet of
Pythian, are most delightful. We stayed at Como two
days, and have now returned to Milan, waiting the issue
of our negotiation about a house. Como is only six
leagues from Milan, and its mountains are seen from
the cathedral.</p>

<p>This cathedral is a most astonishing work of art. It
is built of white marble, and cut into pinnacles of
immense height, and the utmost delicacy of workmanship,
and loaded with sculpture. The effect of it,
piercing the solid blue with those groups of dazzling
spires, relieved by the serene depth of this Italian
heaven, or by moonlight when the stars seem gathered
among those clustered shapes, is beyond any thing I
had imagined architecture capable of producing. The
interior, though very sublime, is of a more earthly
character, and with its stained glass and massy granite
columns overloaded with antique figures, and the silver
lamps, that burn forever under the canopy of black cloth
beside the brazen altar and the marble fretwork of the
dome, give it the aspect of some gorgeous sepulchre.
There is one solitary spot among those aisles, behind
the altar, where the light of day is dim and yellow under
the storied window, which I have chosen to visit, and
read Dante there.</p>

<p>I have devoted this summer, and indeed the next
year, to the composition of a tragedy on the subject
of Tasso’s madness, which I find upon inspection is,
if properly treated, admirably dramatic and poetical.<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
But, you will say, I have no dramatic talent; very true,
in a certain sense; but I have taken the resolution to
see what kind of a tragedy a person without dramatic
talent could write. It shall be better morality than <i>Fazio</i>,
and better poetry than <i>Bertram</i>, at least. You tell me
nothing of <i>Rhododaphne</i>, a book from which, I confess,
I expected extraordinary success.</p>

<p>Who lives in my house at Marlow now, or what is to be
done with it? I am seriously persuaded that the situation
was injurious to my health, or I should be tempted
to feel a very absurd interest in who is to be its next
possessor. The expense of our journey here has been
very considerable&mdash;but we are now living at the hotel
here, in a kind of pension, which is very reasonable in
respect of price, and when we get into a ménage of
our own, we have every reason to expect that we shall
experience something of the boasted cheapness of Italy.
The finest bread, made of a sifted flour, the whitest and
the best I ever tasted, is only <i>one English penny</i> a
pound. All the necessaries of life bear a proportional
relation to this. But then the luxuries, tea, &amp;c., are
very dear,&mdash;and the English, as usual, are cheated in a
way that is quite ridiculous, if they have not their wits
about them. We do not know a single human being,
and the opera, until last night, has been always the same.
Lord Byron, we hear, has taken a house for three years,
at Venice; whether we shall see him or not, I do not
know. The number of English who pass through this
town is very great. They ought to be in their own
country in the present crisis. Their conduct is wholly
inexcusable. The people here, though inoffensive enough,
seem both in body and soul a miserable race. The men
are hardly men; they look like a tribe of stupid and
shrivelled slaves, and I do not think that I have seen a
gleam of intelligence in the countenance of man since
I passed the Alps. The women in enslaved countries are
always better than the men; but they have tight-laced
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
figures, and figures and mien which express (O how unlike
the French!) a mixture of the coquette and prude, which
reminds me of the worst characteristics of the English.
Everything but humanity is in much greater perfection
here than in France. The cleanliness and comfort of
the inns is something quite English. The country is
beautifully cultivated; and altogether, if you can, as one
ought always to do, find your happiness in yourself, it is
a most delightful and commodious place to live in.</p>

<p>I write, simply to tell you, to direct your next letters,
Poste Restante, Pisa. We have engaged a vetturino for
that city, and leave Milan to-morrow morning. Our
journey will occupy six or seven days.</p>

<p>Pisa is not six miles from the Mediterranean, with
which it communicates by the river Arno. We shall
pass by Piacenza, Parma, Bologna, the Apennines, and
Florence, and I will endeavour to tell you something of
these celebrated places in my next letter; but I cannot
promise much, for, though my health is much improved,
my spirits are unequal, and seem to desert me when I
attempt to write.</p>

<p>Pisa, they say, is uninhabitable in the midst of
summer&mdash;we shall do, therefore, what other people do,
retire to Florence, or to the mountains. But I will
write to you our plans from Pisa, when I shall understand
them better myself.</p>

<p>You may easily conjecture the motives which led us
to forego the divine solitude of Como. To me, whose
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
chief pleasure in life is the contemplation of nature, you
may imagine how great is this loss.</p>

<p>We have not heard from you since the middle of
April&mdash;that is, we have received only <i>one</i> letter from
you since our departure from England. It necessarily
follows that some accident has intercepted them.
Address, in future, to the care of Mr. Gisborne,
Livorno&mdash;and I shall receive them, though sometimes
somewhat circuitously, yet always securely.</p>

<p>We left Milan on the first of May, and travelled across
the Apennines to Pisa. This part of the Apennine is
far less beautiful than the Alps; the mountains are wide
and wild, and the whole scenery broad and undetermined&mdash;the
imagination cannot find a home in it. The plain
of the Milanese, and that of Parma, is exquisitely beautiful&mdash;it
is like one garden, or rather cultivated wilderness;
because the corn and the meadow-grass grow
under high and thick trees, festooned to one another by
regular festoons of vines. On the seventh day we arrived
at Pisa, where we remained three or four days. A large
disagreeable city, almost without inhabitants. We then
proceeded to this great trading town, where we have
remained a month, and which, in a few days, we leave
for the Bagni di Lucca, a kind of watering-place situated
in the depth of the Apennines; the scenery surrounding
this village is very fine.</p>

<p>We have made some acquaintance with a very amiable
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
and acccomplished lady, Mrs. Gisborne, who is the sole
attraction in this most unattractive of cities. We had
no idea of spending a month here, but she has made
it even agreeable. We shall see something of Italian
society at the Bagni di Lucca, where the most fashionable
people resort.</p>

<p>When you send my parcel&mdash;which, by-the-bye, I should
request you to direct to Mr. Gisborne&mdash;I wish you could
contrive to enclose the two last parts of Clarke’s Travels,
relating to Greece, and belonging to Hookham. You
know I subscribe there still&mdash;and I have determined to
take the <i>Examiner</i> here. You would, therefore, oblige
me, by sending it weekly, after having read it yourself,
to the same direction, and so clipped, as to make as
little weight as possible.</p>

<p>I write as if writing where perhaps my letter may
never arrive.</p>

<p>You cannot know, as some friends in England do,
to whom my silence is still more inexcusable, that this
silence is no proof of forgetfulness or neglect.</p>

<p>I have, in truth, nothing to say, but that I shall be
happy to see you again, and renew our delightful walks,
until the desire or the duty of seeing new things hurries
us away. We have spent a month here in our accustomed
solitude, with the exception of one night at the
Casino; and the choice society of all ages, which I took
care to pack up in a large trunk before we left England,<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
have revisited us here. I am employed just now, having
little better to do, in translating into my fainting and
inefficient periods, the divine eloquence of Plato’s Symposium;
only as an exercise, or, perhaps, to give Mary
some idea of the manners and feelings of the Athenians&mdash;so
different on many subjects from that of any other
community that ever existed.</p>

<p>We have almost finished Ariosto&mdash;who is entertaining
and graceful, and <i>sometimes</i> a poet. Forgive me,
worshippers of a more equal and tolerant divinity in
poetry, if Ariosto pleases me less than you. Where
is the gentle seriousness, the delicate sensibility, the
calm and sustained energy, without which true greatness
cannot be? He is so cruel, too, in his descriptions;
his most prized virtues are vices almost without disguise.
He constantly vindicates and embellishes revenge in its
grossest form; the most deadly superstition that ever
infested the world. How different from the tender and
solemn enthusiasm of Petrarch&mdash;or even the delicate
moral sensibility of Tasso, though somewhat obscured
by an assumed and artificial style.</p>

<p>We read a good deal here&mdash;and we read little in
Livorno. We have ridden, Mary and I, once only, to
a place called Prato Fiorito, on the top of the mountains:
the road, winding through forests, and over
torrents, and on the verge of green ravines, affords
scenery magnificently fine. I cannot describe it to you,
but bid you, though vainly, come and see. I take great
delight in watching the changes of the atmosphere here,
and the growth of the thunder showers with which the
noon is often overshadowed, and which break and fade
away towards evening into flocks of delicate clouds.
Our fire-flies are fading away fast; but there is the
planet Jupiter, who rises majestically over the rift in
the forest-covered mountains to the south, and the pale
summer lightning which is spread out every night, at
intervals, over the sky. No doubt Providence has contrived
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
these things, that, when the fire-flies go out, the
low-flying owl may see her way home.</p>

<p>Remember me kindly to the Machinista.</p>

<p>With the sentiment of impatience until we see you
again in the autumn,</p>

<p>We have, as yet, seen nothing of Italy which marks
it to us as the habitation of departed greatness. The
serene sky, the magnificent scenery, the delightful productions
of the climate, are known to us, indeed, as the
same with those which the ancients enjoyed. But Rome
and Naples&mdash;even Florence, are yet to see; and if we
were to write you at present a history of our impressions,
it would give you no idea that we lived in Italy.</p>

<p>I am exceedingly delighted with the plan you propose
of a book, illustrating the character of our calumniated
republicans. It is precisely the subject for Mary, and
I imagine, that, but for the fear of being excited to
refer to books not within her reach, she would attempt
to begin it here, and order the works you notice. I am
unfortunately little skilled in English history, and the
interest which it excites in me is so feeble, that I find
it a duty to attain merely to that general knowledge of
it which is indispensable.</p>

<p>Mary has just finished Ariosto with me, and, indeed,
has attained a very competent knowledge of Italian.
She is now reading Livy. I have been constantly
occupied in literature, but have written little&mdash;except
some translations from Plato, in which I exercised
myself, in the despair of producing anything original.<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
The Symposium of Plato seems to me one of the most
valuable pieces of all antiquity, whether we consider the
intrinsic merit of the composition, or the light which it
throws on the inmost state of manners and opinions
among the ancient Greeks. I have occupied myself in
translating this, and it has excited me to attempt an
Essay upon the cause of some differences in sentiment
between the Ancients and Moderns, with respect to the
subject of the dialogue.</p>

<p>Two things give us pleasure in your last letters,&mdash;the
resumption of Malthus, and the favourable turn of the
general election. If Ministers do not find some means,
totally inconceivable to me, of plunging the nation in
war, do you imagine that they can subsist? Peace is
all that a country, in the present state of England,
seems to require, to afford it tranquillity and leisure for
attempting some remedy not to the universal evils of
all constituted society, but to the peculiar system of
misrule under which those evils have been exasperated
now. I wish that I had health or spirits that would
enable me to enter into public affairs, or that I could
find words to express all that I feel and know.</p>

<p>The modern Italians seem a miserable people, without
sensibility, or imagination, or understanding. Their
outside is polished, and an intercourse with them seems
to proceed with much facility, though it ends in nothing,
and produces nothing. The women are particularly
empty, and though possessed of the same kind of superficial
grace, are devoid of every cultivation and refinement.
They have a ball at the Casino here every
Sunday, which we attend&mdash;but neither Mary nor C&mdash;&mdash;
dance. I do not know whether they refrain from philosophy
or protestantism.</p>

<p>I hear that poor Mary’s book is attacked most violently
in the Quarterly Review. We have heard some praise
of it, and among others, an article of Walter Scott’s in
Blackwood’s Magazine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>If you should have anything to send us&mdash;and, I assure
you, anything relating to England is interesting to us&mdash;commit
it to the care of Ollier the bookseller, or P***&mdash;they
send me a parcel every quarter.</p>

<p>My health is, I think, better, and, I imagine, continues
to improve; but I still have busy thoughts and
dispiriting cares, which I would shake off&mdash;and it is
now summer.&mdash;&mdash;A thousand good wishes to yourself
and your undertakings.</p>

<p>We have been delayed in this city four hours, for the
Austrian minister’s passport, but are now on the point
of setting out with a vetturino, who engages to take
us on the third day to Padua; that is, we shall only
sleep three nights on the road. * * * * * Yesterday’s
journey, performed in a one-horse cabriolet, almost
without springs, over a rough road, was excessively
fatiguing. *** suffered most from it; for, as to myself,
there are occasions in which fatigue seems a useful
medicine, as I have felt no pain in my side&mdash;a most
delightful respite&mdash;since I left you. The country was
various and exceedingly beautiful. Sometimes there
were those low cultivated lands, with their vine festoons,
and large bunches of grapes just becoming purple&mdash;at
others we passed between high mountains, crowned
with some of the most majestic Gothic ruins I ever saw,
which frowned from the bare precipices, or were half<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
seen among the olive copses. As we approached
Florence, the country became cultivated to a very high
degree, the plain was filled with the most beautiful
villas, and, as far as the eye could reach, the mountains
were covered with them; for the plains are bounded on
all sides by blue and misty mountains. The vines are
here trailed on low trellises of reeds interwoven into
crosses to support them, and the grapes, now almost
ripe, are exceedingly abundant. You everywhere meet
those teams of beautiful white oxen, which are now
labouring the little vine-divided fields with their Virgilian
ploughs and carts. Florence itself, that is the Lung’
Arno (for I have seen no more), I think is the most
beautiful city I have yet seen. It is surrounded with
cultivated hills, and from the bridge which crosses the
broad channel of the Arno, the view is the most animated
and elegant I ever saw. You see three or four bridges,
one apparently supported by Corinthian pillars, and the
white sails of the boats, relieved by the deep green of
the forest, which comes to the water’s edge, and the
sloping hills covered with bright villas on every side.
Domes and steeples rise on all sides, and the cleanliness
is remarkably great. On the other side there are the
foldings of the Vale of Arno above; first the hills of
olive and vine, then the chesnut woods, and then the
blue and misty pine forests, which invest the aerial
Apennines, that fade in the distance. I have seldom
seen a city so lovely at first sight as Florence.</p>

<p>We shall travel hence within a few hours, with the
speed of the post, since the distance is 190 miles, and
we are to do it in three days, besides the half day, which
is somewhat more than sixty miles a day. We have
now got a comfortable carriage and two mules, and,
thanks to Paolo, have made a very decent bargain,
comprising everything, to Padua. I should say we
had delightful fruit for breakfast,&mdash;figs, very fine&mdash;and
peaches, unfortunately gathered before they were ripe,<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
whose smell was like what one fancies of the wakening
of Paradise flowers.</p>

<p>Well, my dearest Mary, are you very lonely? Tell
me truth, my sweetest, do you ever cry? I shall hear
from you once at Venice, and once on my return here.
If you love me you will keep up your spirits&mdash;and, at
all events, tell me truth about it; for, I assure you, I
am not of a disposition to be flattered by your sorrow,
though I should be by your cheerfulness; and, above
all, by seeing such fruits of my absence as were produced
when we were at Geneva. What acquaintances have
you made? I might have travelled to Padua with a
German, who had just come from Rome, and had scarce
recovered from a malaria fever, caught in the Pontine
Marshes, a week or two since; and I conceded to
***’s entreaties&mdash;and to <i>your</i> absent suggestions, and
omitted the opportunity, although I have no great faith
in such species of contagion. It is not very hot&mdash;not
at all too much so for my sensations, and the only thing
that incommodes me are the gnats at night, who roar
like so many humming tops in one’s ear&mdash;and I do not
always find zanzariere. How is Willmouse and little
Clara? They must be kissed for me&mdash;and you must
particularly remember to speak my name to William,
and see that he does not quite forget me before I
return. Adieu&mdash;my dearest girl, I think that we shall
soon meet. I shall write again from Venice. Adieu,
dear Mary!</p>

<p>I have been reading the “Noble Kinsmen,” in which,
with the exception of that lovely scene, to which you
added so much grace in reading to me, I have been
disappointed. The Jailor’s Daughter is a poor imitation,
and deformed. The whole story wants moral
discrimination and modesty. I do not believe Shakespeare
wrote a word of it.</p>

<p>We arrived here last night at twelve o’clock, and it is
now before breakfast the next morning. I can, of course,
tell you nothing of the future; and though I shall not
close this letter till post time, yet I do not know exactly
when that is. Yet, if you are very impatient, look along
the letter and you will see another date, when I may
have something to relate.</p>

<p>I came from Padua hither in a gondola, and the
gondoliere, among other things, without any hint on my
part, began talking of Lord Byron. He said he was a
<i>giovinotto Inglese</i>, with a <i>nome stravagante</i>, who lived
very luxuriously, and spent great sums of money. This
man, it seems, was one of Lord Byron’s gondolieri.
No sooner had we arrived at the inn, than the waiter
began talking about him&mdash;said, that he frequented
Mrs. H.’s <i>conversazioni</i> very much.</p>

<p>Our journey from Florence to Padua contained nothing
which may not be related another time. At Padua, as
I said, we took a gondola&mdash;and left it at three o’clock.
These gondolas are the most beautiful and convenient
boats in the world. They are finely carpeted and
furnished with black, and painted black. The couches
on which you lean are extraordinarily soft, and are so
disposed as to be the most comfortable to those who
lean or sit. The windows have at will either venetian
plate-glass flowered, or venetian blinds, or blinds of
black cloth to shut out the light. The weather here
is extremely cold&mdash;indeed, sometimes very painfully so,
and yesterday it began to rain. We passed the laguna
in the middle of the night in a most violent storm
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
of wind, rain, and lightning. It was very curious
to observe the elements above in a state of such
tremendous convulsion, and the surface of the water
almost calm; for these lagunas, though five miles
broad, a space enough in a storm to sink a gondola,
are so shallow that the boatmen drive the boat along
with a pole. The sea-water, furiously agitated by the
wind, shone with sparkles like stars. Venice, now
hidden and now disclosed by the driving rain, shone
dimly with its lights. We were all this while safe and
comfortable. Well, adieu, dearest: I shall, as Miss
Byron says,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> resume the pen in the evening.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="right">
<i>Sunday Night, 5 o’clock in the Morning.</i>
</p>

<p>Well, I will try to relate everything in its order.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At three o’clock I called on Lord Byron: he was
delighted to see me.</p>

<p>He took me in his gondola across the laguna to a long
sandy island, which defends Venice from the Adriatic.
When we disembarked, we found his horses waiting for
us, and we rode along the sands of the sea, talking. Our
conversation consisted in histories of his wounded feelings,
and questions as to my affairs, and great professions
of friendship and regard for me. He said, that if he had
been in England at the time of the Chancery affair, he
would have moved heaven and earth to have prevented
such a decision. We talked of literary matters, his
Fourth Canto, which, he says, is very good, and indeed
repeated some stanzas of great energy to me. When
we returned to his palace&mdash;which,</p>

<p class="center">(<i>The letter is here torn.</i>)</p>

<p>The Hoppners are the most amiable people I ever
knew. They are much attached to each other, and
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
have a nice little boy, seven months old. Mr. H. paints
beautifully, and this excursion, which he has just put off,
was an expedition to the Julian Alps, in this neighbourhood&mdash;for
the sake of sketching, to procure winter
employment. He has only a fortnight’s leisure, and he
has sacrificed two days of it to strangers whom he never
saw before. Mrs. H. has hazel eyes and sweet looks.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Paper torn.</i>)</p>

<p>Well, but the time presses, I am now going to the
banker’s to send you money for the journey, which
I shall address to you at Florence, Post-office. Pray
come instantly to Este, where I shall be waiting in the
utmost anxiety for your arrival. You can pack up
directly you get this letter, and employ the next day on
that. The day after, get up at four o’clock, and go
post to Lucca, where you will arrive at six. Then take
a vetturino for Florence to arrive the same evening.
From Florence to Este is three days’ vetturino journey&mdash;and
you could not, I think, do it quicker by the post.
Make Paolo take you to good inns, as we found very
bad ones, and pray avoid the Tre Mori at Bologna,
<i>perche vi sono cose inespressibili nei letti</i>. I do not
think you can, but <i>try</i> to get from Florence to Bologna
in one day. Do not take the post, for it is not much
faster, and very expensive. I have been obliged to
decide on all these things without you: I have done for
the best&mdash;and, my own beloved Mary, you must soon
come and scold me if I have done wrong, and kiss me
if I have done right&mdash;for, I am sure, I do not know
which&mdash;and it is only the event that can show. We
shall at least be saved the trouble of introduction, and
have formed acquaintance with a lady who is so good,
so beautiful, so angelically mild, that were she as wise
too, she would be quite a ***. Her eyes are like a
reflection of yours. Her manners are like yours when
you know and like a person.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>Do you know, dearest, how this letter was written?
By scraps and patches, and interrupted every minute.
The gondola is now come to take me to the banker’s.
Este is a little place, and the house found without difficulty.
I shall count four days for this letter: one day
for packing, four for coming here&mdash;and on the ninth or
tenth day we shall meet.</p>

<p>I am too late for the post&mdash;but I send an express to
overtake it. Enclosed is an order for fifty pounds. If
you knew all that I had to do!&mdash;</p>

<p>Dearest love, be well, be happy, come to me&mdash;confide
in your own constant and affectionate,</p>

<p>I found at Mount Selice a favourable opportunity
for going to Venice, where I shall try to make some
arrangement for you and little Ca.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> to come for some
days, and shall meet you, if I do not write anything in
the mean time, at Padua, on Thursday morning. C.
says she is obliged to come to see the Medico, whom
we missed this morning, and who has appointed as the
only hour at which he can be at leisure&mdash;half-past eight
in the morning. You must, therefore, arrange matters
so that you should come to the Stella d’Oro a little
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
before that hour&mdash;a thing to be accomplished only by
setting out at half-past three in the morning. You will
by this means arrive at Venice very early in the day,
and avoid the heat, which might be bad for the babe,
and take the time, when she would at least sleep great
part of the time. C. will return with the return carriage,
and I shall meet you, or send to you at Padua.</p>

<p>Meanwhile remember Charles the First&mdash;and do
you be prepared to bring at least <i>some</i> of Myrra translated;
bring the book also with you, and the sheets of
“Prometheus Unbound,” which you will find numbered
from one to twenty-six on the table of the pavilion. My
poor little Clara, how is she to-day? Indeed I am
somewhat uneasy about her, and though I feel secure
that there is no danger, it would be very comfortable to
have some reasonable person’s opinion about her. The
Medico at Padua is certainly a man in great practice,
but I confess he does not satisfy me.</p>

<p>Am I not like a wild swan to be gone so suddenly?
But, in fact, to set off alone to Venice required an
exertion. I felt myself capable of making it, and I
knew that you desired it. What will not be&mdash;if so it is
destined&mdash;the lonely journey through that wide, cold
France? But we shall see.</p>

<p>Adieu, my dearest love&mdash;remember Charles I. and
Myrra. I have been already imagining how you will
conduct some scenes. The second volume of “St
Leon” begins with this proud and true sentiment&mdash;“There
is nothing which the human mind can conceive,
which it may not execute.” Shakespeare was only a
human being.</p>

<p>I have not written to you, I think, for six weeks.
But I have been on the point of writing many times,
and have often felt that I had many things to say. But
I have not been without events to disturb and distract
me, amongst which is the death of my little girl. She
died of a disorder peculiar to the climate. We have all
had bad spirits enough, and I, in addition, bad health.
I <i>intend</i> to be better soon: there is no malady, bodily
or mental, which does not either kill or is killed.</p>

<p>We left the Baths of Lucca, I think, the day after I
wrote to you&mdash;on a visit to Venice&mdash;partly for the sake
of seeing the city. We made a very delightful acquaintance
there with a Mr. and Mrs. Hoppner, the gentleman
an Englishman, and the lady a Swissesse, mild and
beautiful, and unprejudiced, in the best sense of the
word. The kind attentions of these people made our
short stay at Venice very pleasant. I saw Lord Byron,
and really hardly knew him again; he is changed into
the liveliest and happiest-looking man I ever met. He
read me the first canto of his “Don Juan”&mdash;a thing in
the style of Beppo, but infinitely better, and dedicated
to Southey, in ten or a dozen stanzas, more like a mixture
of wormwood and verdigris than satire. Venice
is a wonderfully fine city. The approach to it over the
laguna, with its domes and turrets glittering in a long
line over the blue waves, is one of the finest architectural
delusions in the world. It seems to have&mdash;and literally
it has&mdash;its foundations in the sea. The silent streets are
paved with water, and you hear nothing but the dashing
of the oars, and the occasional cries of the gondolieri.
I heard nothing of Tasso. The gondolas themselves<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
are things of a most romantic and picturesque appearance;
I can only compare them to moths of which a
coffin might have been the chrysalis. They are hung
with black, and painted black, and carpeted with grey;
they curl at the prow and stern, and at the former there
is a nondescript beak of shining steel, which glitters at
the end of its long black mass.</p>

<p>The Doge’s palace, with its library, is a fine monument
of aristocratic power. I saw the dungeons, where
these scoundrels used to torment their victims. They
are of three kinds&mdash;one adjoining the place of trial,
where the prisoners destined to immediate execution
were kept. I could not descend into them, because the
day on which I visited it, was festa. Another under the
leads of the palace, where the sufferers were roasted to
death or madness by the ardours of an Italian sun: and
others called the Pozzi&mdash;or wells, deep underneath, and
communicating with those on the roof by secret passages&mdash;where
the prisoners were confined sometimes half up
to their middles in stinking water. When the French
came here, they found only one old man in the dungeons,
and he could not speak. But Venice, which was once
a tyrant, is now the next worse thing, a slave; for in
fact it ceased to be free, or worth our regret as a nation,
from the moment that the oligarchy usurped the rights
of the people. Yet, I do not imagine that it was ever
so degraded as it has been since the French, and
especially the Austrian yoke. The Austrians take sixty
per cent. in taxes, and impose free quarters on the
inhabitants. A horde of German soldiers, as vicious
and more disgusting than the Venetians themselves,
insult these miserable people. I had no conception
of the excess to which avarice, cowardice, superstition,
ignorance, passionless lust, and all the inexpressible
brutalities which degrade human nature, could be
carried, until I had passed a few days at Venice.</p>

<p>We have been living this last month near the little<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
town from which I date this letter, in a very pleasant
villa which has been lent to us, and we are now on the
point of proceeding to Florence, Rome, and Naples&mdash;at
which last city we shall spend the winter, and return
northwards in the spring. Behind us here are the
Euganean hills, not so beautiful as those of the Bagni
di Lucca, with Arquà, where Petrarch’s house and tomb
are religiously preserved and visited. At the end of our
garden is an extensive Gothic castle, now the habitation
of owls and bats, where the Medici family resided before
they came to Florence. We see before us the wide flat
plains of Lombardy, in which we see the sun and moon
rise and set, and the evening star, and all the golden
magnificence of autumnal clouds. But I reserve wonder
for Naples.</p>

<p>I have been writing&mdash;and indeed have just finished
the first act of a lyric and classical drama, to be called
“Prometheus Unbound.” Will you tell me what there
is in Cicero about a drama supposed to have been
written by Æschylus under this title?</p>

<p>I ought to say that I have just read Malthus in a
French translation. Malthus is a very clever man, and
the world would be a great gainer if it would seriously
take his lessons into consideration, if it were capable of
attending seriously to anything but mischief&mdash;but what
on earth does he mean by some of his inferences?</p>

spirits, and to more agreeable purpose, I hope. You
saw those beautiful stanzas in the fourth canto<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> about
the Nymph Egeria. Well, I did not whisper a word

<p>We left Este yesterday on our journey towards
Naples. The roads were particularly bad; we have,
therefore, accomplished only two days’ journey, of
eighteen and twenty-four miles each, and you may
imagine that our horses must be tolerably good ones, to
drag our carriage, with five people and heavy luggage,
through deep and clayey roads. The roads are, however,
good during the rest of the way.</p>

<p>The country is flat, but intersected by lines of wood,
trellised with vines, whose broad leaves are now stamped
with the redness of their decay. Every here and there
one sees people employed in agricultural labours, and
the plough, the harrow, or the cart, drawn by long
teams of milk-white or dove-coloured oxen of immense
size and exquisite beauty. This, indeed, might be the
country of Pasiphaes. In one farm-yard I was shown
sixty-three of these lovely oxen, tied to their stalls, in
excellent condition. A farm-yard in this part of Italy
is somewhat different from one in England. First, the
house, which is large and high, with strange-looking
unpainted window-shutters, generally closed, and dreary
beyond conception. The farm-yard and out-buildings,
however, are usually in the neatest order. The threshing-floor
is not under cover, but like that described in
the Georgics, usually flattened by a broken column, and
neither the mole, nor the toad, nor the ant, can find on
its area a crevice for their dwelling. Around it, at this
season, are piled the stacks of the leaves and stalks of
Indian corn, which has lately been threshed and dried
upon its surface. At a little distance are vast heaps of
many-coloured zucchi or pumpkins, some of enormous
size, piled as winter food for the hogs. There are<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
turkeys, too, and fowls wandering about, and two or
three dogs, who bark with a sharp hylactism. The
people who are occupied with the care of these things
seem neither ill-clothed nor ill-fed, and the blunt incivility
of their manners has an English air with it, very
discouraging to those who are accustomed to the impudent
and polished lying of the inhabitants of the
cities. I should judge the agricultural resources of this
country to be immense, since it can wear so flourishing
an appearance, in spite of the enormous discouragements
which the various tyranny of the governments inflicts
on it. I ought to say that one of the farms belongs to
a Jew banker at Venice, another Shylock.&mdash;We arrived
late at the inn where I now write; it was once the
palace of a Venetian nobleman, and is now an excellent
inn. To-morrow we are going to see the sights of
Ferrara.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="right">
<i>Nov. 9.</i>
</p>

<p>We have had heavy rain and thunder all night; and
the former still continuing, we went in the carriage about
the town. We went first to look at the cathedral, but
the beggars very soon made us sound a retreat; so,
whether, as it is said, there is a copy of a picture of
Michael Angelo there or no, I cannot tell. At the
public library we were more successful. This is, indeed,
a magnificent establishment, containing, as they say,
160,000 volumes. We saw some illuminated manuscripts
of church music, with the verses of the psalms
interlined between the square notes, each of which
consisted of the most delicate tracery, in colours inconceivably
vivid. They belonged to the neighbouring
convent of Certolda, and are three or four hundred
years old; but their hues are as fresh as if they had
been executed yesterday. The tomb of Ariosto occupies
one end of the largest saloon of which the library is
composed; it is formed of various marbles, surmounted<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
by an expressive bust of the poet, and subscribed with a
few Latin verses, in a less miserable taste than those
usually employed for similar purposes. But the most
interesting exhibitions here, are the writings, &amp;c., of
Ariosto and Tasso, which are preserved, and were
concealed from the undistinguishing depredations of
the French with pious care. There is the arm-chair
of Ariosto, an old plain wooden piece of furniture, the
hard seat of which was once occupied by, but has now
survived its cushion, as it has its master. I could
fancy Ariosto sitting in it; and the satires in his own
handwriting which they unfold beside it, and the old
bronze inkstand, loaded with figures, which belonged
also to him, assists the willing delusion. This inkstand
has an antique, rather than an ancient appearance.
Three nymphs lean forth from the circumference, and
on the top of the lid stands a cupid, winged and looking
up, with a torch in one hand, his bow in the other, and
his quiver beside him. A medal was bound round the
skeleton of Ariosto, with his likeness impressed upon
it. I cannot say I think it had much native expression,
but, perhaps, the artist was in fault. On the reverse
is a hand, cutting with a pair of scissors the tongue
from a serpent, upraised from the grass, with this legend&mdash;<i>Pro
bono malum</i>. What this reverse of the boasted
Christian maxim means, or how it applies to Ariosto,
either as a satirist or a serious writer, I cannot exactly
tell. The cicerone attempted to explain, and it is to his
commentary that my bewildering is probably due&mdash;if,
indeed, the meaning be very plain, as is possibly the
case.</p>

<p>There is here a manuscript of the entire Gerusalemme
Liberata, written by Tasso’s own hand; a manuscript
of some poems, written in prison, to the Duke Alfonso;
and the satires of Ariosto, written also by his own hand;
and the Pastor Fido of Guarini. The Gerusalemme,
though it had evidently been copied and recopied, is<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
interlined, particularly towards the end, with numerous
corrections. The handwriting of Ariosto is a small,
firm, and pointed character, expressing, as I should say,
a strong and keen, but circumscribed energy of mind;
that of Tasso is large, free, and flowing, except that
there is a checked expression in the midst of its flow,
which brings the letters into a smaller compass than
one expected from the beginning of the word. It is the
symbol of an intense and earnest mind, exceeding at
times its own depth, and admonished to return by the
chillness of the waters of oblivion striking upon its adventurous
feet. You know I always seek in what I see
the manifestation of something beyond the present and
tangible object; and as we do not agree in physiognomy,
so we may not agree now. But my business
is to relate my own sensations, and not to attempt to
inspire others with them. Some of the MSS. of Tasso
were sonnets to his persecutor, which contain a great
deal of what is called flattery. If Alfonso’s ghost were
asked how he felt those praises now, I wonder what he
would say. But to me there is much more to pity than
to condemn in these entreaties and praises of Tasso.
It is as a bigot prays to and praises his god, whom he
knows to be the most remorseless, capricious, and inflexible
of tyrants, but whom he knows also to be omnipotent.
Tasso’s situation was widely different from
that of any persecuted being of the present day; for,
from the depth of dungeons, public opinion might now
at length be awakened to an echo that would startle the
oppressor. But then there was no hope. There is
something irresistibly pathetic to me in the sight of
Tasso’s own handwriting, moulding expressions of adulation
and entreaty to a deaf and stupid tyrant, in an age
when the most heroic virtue would have exposed its possessor
to hopeless persecution, and&mdash;such is the alliance
between virtue and genius&mdash;which unoffending genius
could not escape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_248">[Pg 248]</span></p>

<p>We went afterwards to see his prison in the hospital
of Sant’ Anna, and I enclose you a piece of the
wood of the very door, which for seven years and three
months divided this glorious being from the air and
the light which had nourished in him those influences
which he has communicated, through his poetry, to
thousands. The dungeon is low and dark, and, when
I say that it is really a very decent dungeon, I speak
as one who has seen the prisons in the Doge’s palace of
Venice. But it is a horrible abode for the coarsest and
meanest thing that ever wore the shape of man, much
more for one of delicate susceptibilities and elevated
fancies. It is low, and has a grated window, and
being sunk some feet below the level of the earth, is
full of unwholesome damps. In the darkest corner is a
mark in the wall where the chains were rivetted, which
bound him hand and foot. After some time, at the
instance of some Cardinal, his friend, the Duke allowed
his victim a fireplace; the mark where it was walled up
yet remains.</p>

<p>At the entrance of the Liceo, where the library is, we
were met by a penitent; his form was completely enveloped
in a ghost-like drapery of white flannel; his bare
feet were sandalled; and there was a kind of net-work
visor drawn over his eyes, so as entirely to conceal his
face. I imagine that this man had been adjudged to
suffer this penance for some crime known only to himself
and his confessor, and this kind of exhibition is a
striking instance of the power of the Catholic superstition
over the human mind. He passed, rattling his
wooden box for charity.</p>

<i>Bologna, Monday, Nov. 9th, 1818.</i>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Peacock</span>,</p>
</div>

<p>I have seen a quantity of things here&mdash;churches,
palaces, statues, fountains, and pictures; and my brain
is at this moment like a portfolio of an architect, or a
print-shop, or a common-place book. I will try to recollect
something of what I have seen; for, indeed, it
requires, if it will obey, an act of volition. First, we
went to the cathedral, which contains nothing remarkable,
except a kind of shrine, or rather a marble canopy,
loaded with sculptures, and supported on four marble
columns. We went then to a palace&mdash;I am sure I
forget the name of it&mdash;where we saw a large gallery of
pictures. Of course, in a picture gallery you see three
hundred pictures you forget, for one you remember. I
remember, however, an interesting picture by Guido, of
the Rape of Proserpine, in which Proserpine casts back
her languid and half-unwilling eyes, as it were, to the
flowers she had left ungathered in the fields of Enna.
There was an exquisitely executed piece of Correggio,
about four saints, one of whom seemed to have a pet
dragon in a leash. I was told that it was the devil who
was bound in that style&mdash;but who can make anything of
four saints? For what can they be supposed to be about?
There was one painting, indeed, by this master, Christ
beatified, inexpressibly fine. It is a half figure, seated
on a mass of clouds, tinged with an ethereal, rose-like
lustre; the arms are expanded; the whole frame seems
dilated with expression; the countenance is heavy, as it
were, with the weight of the rapture of the spirit; the
lips parted, but scarcely parted, with the breath of
intense but regulated passion; the eyes are calm and
benignant; the whole features harmonised in majesty
and sweetness. The hair is parted on the forehead,
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
and falls in heavy locks on each side. It is motionless,
but seems as if the faintest breath would move it. The
colouring, I suppose, must be very good, if I could
remark and understand it. The sky is of a pale aerial
orange, like the tints of latest sunset; it does not seem
painted around and beyond the figure, but everything
seems to have absorbed, and to have been penetrated by
its hues. I do not think we saw any other of Correggio,
but this specimen gives me a very exalted idea of his
powers.</p>

<p>We went to see heaven knows how many more
palaces&mdash;Ranuzzi, Marriscalchi, Aldobrandi. If you
want Italian names for any purpose, here they are; I
should be glad of them if I was writing a novel. I saw
many more of Guido. One, a Samson drinking water
out of an ass’s jaw-bone, in the midst of the slaughtered
Philistines. Why he is supposed to do this, God, who
gave him this jaw-bone, alone knows&mdash;but certain it is,
that the painting is a very fine one. The figure of Samson
stands in strong relief in the foreground, coloured, as
it were, in the hues of human life, and full of strength
and elegance. Round him lie the Philistines in all the
attitudes of death. One prone, with the slight convulsion
of pain just passing from his forehead, whilst on
his lips and chin death lies as heavy as sleep. Another
leaning on his arm, with his hand, white and motionless,
hanging out beyond. In the distance, more dead
bodies; and, still further beyond, the blue sea and the
blue mountains, and one white and tranquil sail.</p>

<p>There is a Murder of the Innocents, also, by Guido,
finely coloured, with much fine expression&mdash;but the
subject is very horrible, and it seemed deficient in
strength&mdash;at least, you require the highest ideal energy,
the most poetical and exalted conception of the subject,
to reconcile you to such a contemplation. There was
a Jesus Christ crucified, by the same, very fine. One
gets tired, indeed, whatever may be the conception and<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
execution of it, of seeing that monotonous and agonised
form for ever exhibited in one prescriptive attitude of
torture. But the Magdalen, clinging to the cross, with
the look of passive and gentle despair beaming from
beneath her bright flaxen hair, and the figure of St.
John, with his looks uplifted in passionate compassion;
his hands clasped, and his fingers twisting themselves
together, as it were, with involuntary anguish; his feet
almost writhing up from the ground with the same
sympathy; and the whole of this arrayed in colours of
a diviner nature, yet most like nature’s self. Of the
contemplation of this one would never weary.</p>

<p>There was a “Fortune” too, of Guido; a piece of
mere beauty. There was the figure of Fortune on a
globe, eagerly proceeding onwards, and Love was trying
to catch her back by the hair, and her face was half
turned towards him; her long chesnut hair was floating
in the stream of the wind, and threw its shadow over
her fair forehead. Her hazel eyes were fixed on her
pursuer, with a meaning look of playfulness, and a light
smile was hovering on her lips. The colours which
arrayed her delicate limbs were ethereal and warm.</p>

<p>But, perhaps, the most interesting of all the pictures
of Guido which I saw, was a Madonna Lattante. She
is leaning over her child, and the maternal feelings with
which she is pervaded are shadowed forth on her soft
and gentle countenance, and in her simple and affectionate
gestures&mdash;there is what an unfeeling observer
would call a dulness in the expression of her face; her
eyes are almost closed; her lip depressed; there is a
serious, and even a heavy relaxation, as it were, of all
the muscles which are called into action by ordinary
emotions; but it is only as if the spirit of love, almost
insupportable from its intensity, were brooding over and
weighing down the soul, or whatever it is, without which
the material frame is inanimate and inexpressive.</p>

<p>There is another painter here, called Franceschini, a<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
Bolognese, who, though certainly very inferior to Guido,
is yet a person of excellent powers. One entire church,
that of Santa Catarina, is covered by his works. I do
not know whether any of his pictures have ever been
seen in England. His colouring is less warm than that
of Guido, but nothing can be more clear and delicate,
it is as if he could have dipped his pencil in the hues of
some serenest and star-shining twilight. His forms have
the same delicacy and aerial loveliness; their eyes are all
bright with innocence and love; their lips scarce divided
by some gentle and sweet emotion. His winged children
are the loveliest ideal beings ever created by the human
mind. These are generally, whether in the capacity of
Cherubim or Cupid, accessories to the rest of the picture;
and the underplot of their lovely and infantine play is
something almost pathetic, from the excess of its unpretending
beauty. One of the best of his pieces is an
Annunciation of the Virgin; the Angel is beaming in
beauty; the Virgin, soft, retiring, and simple.</p>

<p>We saw besides one picture of Raphael&mdash;St. Cecilia:
this is in another and higher style; you forget that it is
a picture as you look at it; and yet it is most unlike any
of those things which we call reality. It is of the inspired
and ideal kind, and seems to have been conceived and
executed in a similar state of feeling to that which produced
among the ancients those perfect specimens of
poetry and sculpture which are the baffling models of
succeeding generations. There is a unity and a perfection
in it of an incommunicable kind. The central
figure, St. Cecilia, seems rapt in such inspiration as
produced her image in the painter’s mind; her deep,
dark, eloquent eyes lifted up; her chesnut hair flung
back from her forehead&mdash;she holds an organ in her
hands&mdash;her countenance, as it were, calmed by the
depth of its passion and rapture, and penetrated
throughout with the warm and radiant light of life.
She is listening to the music of heaven, and, as I<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
imagine, has just ceased to sing, for the four figures
that surround her evidently point, by their attitudes,
towards her; particularly St. John, who, with a tender
yet impassioned gesture, bends his countenance towards
her, languid with the depth of his emotion. At her
feet lie various instruments of music, broken and unstrung.
Of the colouring I do not speak; it eclipses
nature, yet it has all her truth and softness.</p>

<p>We saw some pictures of Domenichino, Carracci,
Albano, Guercino, Elisabetta Sirani. The two former,
remember, I do not pretend to taste&mdash;I cannot admire.
Of the latter there are some beautiful Madonnas. There
are several of Guercino, which they said were very fine.
I dare say they were, for the strength and complication
of his figures made my head turn round. One,
indeed, was certainly powerful. It was the representation
of the founder of the Carthusians exercising his austerities
in the desert, with a youth as his attendant, kneeling
beside him at an altar: on another altar stood a skull
and a crucifix; and around were the rocks and the trees
of the wilderness. I never saw such a figure as this
fellow. His face was wrinkled like a dried snake’s skin,
and drawn in long hard lines: his very hands were
wrinkled. He looked like an animated mummy. He
was clothed in a loose dress of death-coloured flannel,
such as you might fancy a shroud might be, after it had
wrapt a corpse a month or two. It had a yellow, putrefied,
ghastly hue, which it cast on all the objects around,
so that the hands and face of the Carthusian and his
companion were jaundiced by this sepulchral glimmer.
Why write books against religion, when we may hang
up such pictures? But the world either will not or
cannot see. The gloomy effect of this was softened,
and, at the same time, its sublimity diminished, by the
figure of the Virgin and Child in the sky, looking down
with admiration on the monk, and a beautiful flying
figure of an angel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_254">[Pg 254]</span></p>

<p>Enough of pictures. I saw the place where Guido
and his mistress, Elisabetta Sirani, were buried. This
lady was poisoned at the age of twenty-six, by another
lover, a rejected one, of course. Our guide said she
was very ugly, and that we might see her portrait to-morrow.</p>

<p>Well, good-night, for the present. “To-morrow to
fresh fields and pastures new.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="right">
<i>Nov. 10.</i>
</p>

<p>To-day we first went to see those divine pictures of
Raffael and Guido again, and then rode up the mountains,
behind this city, to visit a chapel dedicated to
the Madonna. It made me melancholy to see that
they had been varnishing and restoring some of these
pictures, and that even some had been pierced by the
French bayonets. These are symptoms of the mortality
of man; and, perhaps, few of his works are more evanescent
than paintings. Sculpture retains its freshness for
twenty centuries&mdash;the Apollo and the Venus are as they
were. But books are perhaps the only productions of
man coeval with the human race. Sophocles and Shakespeare
can be produced and reproduced for ever. But
how evanescent are paintings, and must necessarily be.
Those of Zeuxis and Apelles are no more, and perhaps
they bore the same relation to Homer and Æschylus,
that those of Guido and Raffael bear to Dante and
Petrarch. There is one refuge from the despondency
of this contemplation. The material part, indeed, of
their works must perish, but they survive in the mind
of man, and the remembrances connected with them are
transmitted from generation to generation. The poet
embodies them in his creations; the systems of philosophers
are modelled to gentleness by their contemplation;
opinion, that legislator, is infected with their
influence; men become better and wiser; and the<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
unseen seeds are perhaps thus sown, which shall produce
a plant more excellent even than that from which they
fell. But all this might as well be said or thought at
Marlow as Bologna.</p>

<p>The chapel of the Madonna is a very pretty Corinthian
building&mdash;very beautiful, indeed. It commands
a fine view of these fertile plains, the many-folded
Apennines, and the city. I have just returned from a
moonlight walk through Bologna. It is a city of colonnades,
and the effect of moonlight is strikingly picturesque.
There are two towers here&mdash;one 400 feet high&mdash;ugly
things, built of brick, which lean both different
ways; and with the delusion of moonlight shadows, you
might almost fancy that the city is rocked by an earthquake.
They say they were built so on purpose; but
I observe in all the plain of Lombardy the church
towers lean.</p>

<p>Adieu.&mdash;God grant you patience to read this long
letter, and courage to support the expectation of the
next. Pray part them from the <i>Cobbetts</i> on your breakfast
table&mdash;they may fight it out in your mind.</p>

But I have seen nothing except St. Peter’s and the

and the Dogana, where they took us to have our luggage
examined, which is built between the ruins of a temple
to Antoninus Pius. The Corinthian columns rise over
the dwindled palaces of the modern town, and the
wrought cornice is changed on one side, as it were, to<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
masses of wave-worn precipice, which overhang you, far,
far on high.</p>

<p>I take advantage of this rainy evening, and before
Rome has effaced all other recollections, to endeavour
to recall the vanished scenes through which we have
passed. We left Bologna, I forget on what day, and
passing by Rimini, Fano, and Foligno, along the Via
Flaminia and Terni, have arrived at Rome after ten
days’ somewhat tedious, but most interesting, journey.
The most remarkable things we saw were the Roman
excavations in the rock, and the great waterfall of Terni.
Of course you have heard that there are a Roman bridge
and a triumphal arch at Rimini, and in what excellent
taste they are built. The bridge is not unlike the Strand
bridge, but more bold in proportion, and of course infinitely
smaller. From Fano we left the coast of the
Adriatic, and entered the Apennines, following the course
of the Metaurus, the banks of which were the scene of
the defeat of Asdrubal: and it is said (you can refer to
the book) that Livy has given a very exact and animated
description of it. I forget all about it, but shall look as
soon as our boxes are opened. Following the river, the
vale contracts, the banks of the river become steep and
rocky, the forests of oak and ilex which overhang its
emerald-coloured stream, cling to their abrupt precipices.
About four miles from Fossombrone, the river forces for
itself a passage between the walls and toppling precipices
of the loftiest Apennines, which are here rifted to
their base, and undermined by the narrow and tumultuous
torrent. It was a cloudy morning, and we had
no conception of the scene that awaited us. Suddenly
the low clouds were struck by the clear north wind, and
like curtains of the finest gauze, removed one by one,
were drawn from before the mountain, whose heaven-cleaving
pinnacles and black crags overhanging one
another, stood at length defined in the light of day.
The road runs parallel to the river, at a considerable<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
height, and is carried through the mountain by a vaulted
cavern. The marks of the chisel of the legionaries of
the Roman Consul are yet evident.</p>

<p>We passed on day after day, until we came to
Spoleto, I think the most romantic city I ever saw.
There is here an aqueduct of astonishing elevation,
which unites two rocky mountains,&mdash;there is the path
of a torrent below, whitening the green dell with its
broad and barren track of stones, and above there is a
castle, apparently of great strength and of tremendous
magnitude, which overhangs the city, and whose marble
bastions are perpendicular with the precipice. I never
saw a more impressive picture; in which the shapes
of nature are of the grandest order, but over which
the creations of man, sublime from their antiquity and
greatness, seem to predominate. The castle was built
by Belisarius or Narses, I forget which, but was of that
epoch.</p>

<p>From Spoleto we went to Terni, and saw the cataract
of the Velino. The glaciers of Montanvert and the
source of the Arveiron is the grandest spectacle I ever
saw. This is the second. Imagine a river sixty feet
in breadth, with a vast volume of waters, the outlet
of a great lake among the higher mountains, falling 300
feet into a sightless gulf of snow-white vapour, which
bursts up for ever and for ever from a circle of black
crags, and thence leaping downwards, makes five or six
other cataracts, each fifty or a hundred feet high, which
exhibit, on a smaller scale, and with beautiful and
sublime variety, the same appearances. But words (and
far less could painting) will not express it. Stand upon
the brink of the platform of cliff, which is directly opposite.
You see the ever-moving water stream down. It
comes in thick and tawny folds, flaking off like solid
snow gliding down a mountain. It does not seem
hollow within, but without it is unequal, like the folding
of linen thrown carelessly down; your eye follows it,<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
and it is lost below; not in the black rocks which gird
it around, but in its own foam and spray, in the cloud-like
vapours boiling up from below, which is not like
rain, nor mist, nor spray, nor foam, but water, in a
shape wholly unlike anything I ever saw before. It is
as white as snow, but thick and impenetrable to the
eye. The very imagination is bewildered in it. A
thunder comes up from the abyss wonderful to hear;
for, though it ever sounds, it is never the same, but,
modulated by the changing motion, rises and falls
intermittingly; we passed half an hour in one spot
looking at it, and thought but a few minutes had gone
by. The surrounding scenery is, in its kind, the
loveliest and most sublime that can be conceived. In
our first walk we passed through some olive groves,
of large and ancient trees, whose hoary and twisted
trunks leaned in all directions. We then crossed a
path of orange trees by the river side, laden with their
golden fruit, and came to a forest of ilex of a large
size, whose evergreen and acorn-bearing boughs were
intertwined over our winding path. Around, hemming
in the narrow vale, were pinnacles of lofty mountains
of pyramidical rock clothed with all evergreen plants
and trees; the vast pine whose feathery foliage trembled
in the blue air, the ilex, that ancestral inhabitant of
these mountains, the arbutus with its crimson-coloured
fruit and glittering leaves. After an hour’s walk, we
came beneath the cataract of Terni, within the distance
of half a mile; nearer you cannot approach, for the
Nar, which has here its confluence with the Velino,
bars the passage. We then crossed the river formed
by this confluence, over a narrow natural bridge of
rock, and saw the cataract from the platform I first
mentioned. We think of spending some time next
year near this waterfall. The inn is very bad, or we
should have stayed there longer.</p>

<p>We came from Terni last night to a place called
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
Nepi, and to-day arrived at Rome across the much-belied
Campagna di Roma, a place I confess infinitely
to my taste. It is a flattering picture of Bagshot Heath.
But then there are the Apennines on one side, and Rome
and St. Peter’s on the other, and it is intersected by
perpetual dells clothed with arbutus and ilex.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Peacock</span></p>
</div>

<p>I have received a letter from you here, dated
November 1st; you see the reciprocation of letters
from the term of our travels is more slow. I entirely
agree with what you say about <i>Childe Harold</i>. The
spirit in which it is written is, if insane, the most
wicked and mischievous insanity that ever was given
forth. It is a kind of obstinate and self-willed folly, in
which he hardens himself. I remonstrated with him
in vain on the tone of mind from which such a view
of things alone arises. For its real root is very different
from its apparent one. Nothing can be less
sublime than the true source of these expressions of
contempt and desperation. The fact is, that first, the
Italian women with whom he associates, are perhaps the
most contemptible of all who exist under the moon&mdash;the
most ignorant, the most disgusting, the most bigoted;
* * * * an ordinary Englishman cannot approach
them. Well, Lord Byron is familiar with the lowest
sort of these women, the people his gondolieri pick up
in the streets. He associates with wretches who seem
almost to have lost the gait and physiognomy of man,
and who do not scruple to avow practices, which are<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
not only not named, but I believe seldom even conceived
in England. He says he disapproves, but he
endures. He is heartily and deeply discontented with
himself; and contemplating in the distorted mirror
of his own thoughts the nature and the destiny of
man, what can he behold but objects of contempt
and despair? But that he is a great poet, I think
the address to Ocean proves. And he has a certain
degree of candour while you talk to him, but unfortunately
it does not outlast your departure. No,
I do not doubt, and, for his sake, I ought to hope,
that his present career must end soon in some violent
circumstance.</p>

<p>Since I last wrote to you, I have seen the ruins of
Rome, the Vatican, St. Peter’s, and all the miracles of
ancient and modern art contained in that majestic city.
The impression of it exceeds anything I have ever
experienced in my travels. We stayed there only a
week, intending to return at the end of February, and
devote two or three months to its mines of inexhaustible
contemplation, to which period I refer you for a minute
account of it. We visited the Forum and the ruins of
the Coliseum every day. The Coliseum is unlike any
work of human hands I ever saw before. It is of
enormous height and circuit, and the arches built of
massy stones are piled on one another, and jut into the
blue air, shattered into the forms of overhanging rocks.
It has been changed by time into the image of an
amphitheatre of rocky hills overgrown by the wild olive,
the myrtle, and the fig-tree, and threaded by little paths,
which wind among its ruined stairs and immeasurable
galleries: the copse-wood overshadows you as you
wander through its labyrinths, and the wild weeds of
this climate of flowers bloom under your feet. The
arena is covered with grass, and pierces, like the skirts
of a natural plain, the chasms of the broken arches
around. But a small part of the exterior circumference<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
remains&mdash;it is exquisitely light and beautiful; and the
effect of the perfection of its architecture, adorned with
ranges of Corinthian pilasters, supporting a bold cornice,
is such, as to diminish the effect of its greatness. The
interior is all ruin. I can scarcely believe that when
encrusted with Dorian marble and ornamented by
columns of Egyptian granite its effect could have been
so sublime and so impressive as in its present state. It
is open to the sky, and it was the clear and sunny
weather of the end of November in this climate when
we visited it, day after day.</p>

<p>Near it is the arch of Constantine, or rather the arch
of Trajan; for the servile and avaricious senate of
degraded Rome ordered that the monument of his
predecessor should be demolished in order to dedicate
one to the Christian reptile, who had crept among the
blood of his murdered family to the supreme power.
It is exquisitely beautiful and perfect. The Forum is
a plain in the midst of Rome, a kind of desert full
of heaps of stones and pits, and though so near the
habitations of men, is the most desolate place you can
conceive. The ruins of temples stand in and around
it, shattered columns and ranges of others complete,
supporting cornices of exquisite workmanship, and vast
vaults of shattered domes distinct with regular compartments,
once filled with sculptures of ivory or brass.
The temples of Jupiter, and Concord, and Peace, and
the Sun, and the Moon, and Vesta, are all within a
short distance of this spot. Behold the wrecks of what
a great nation once dedicated to the abstractions of the
mind! Rome is a city, as it were, of the dead, or
rather of those who cannot die, and who survive the
puny generations which inhabit and pass over the spot
which they have made sacred to eternity. In Rome,
at least in the first enthusiasm of your recognition of
ancient time, you see nothing of the Italians. The
nature of the city assists the delusion, for its vast and<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
antique walls describe a circumference of sixteen miles,
and thus the population is thinly scattered over this
space, nearly as great as London. Wide wild fields
are enclosed within it, and there are grassy lanes and
copses winding among the ruins, and a great green
hill, lonely and bare, which overhangs the Tiber. The
gardens of the modern palaces are like wild woods of
cedar, and cypress, and pine, and the neglected walks
are overgrown with weeds. The English burying-place
is a green slope near the walls, under the pyramidal
tomb of Cestius, and is, I think, the most beautiful and
solemn cemetery I ever beheld. To see the sun shining
on its bright grass, fresh, when we first visited it, with
the autumnal dews, and hear the whispering of the wind
among the leaves of the trees which have overgrown the
tomb of Cestius, and the soil which is stirring in the
sun-warm earth, and to mark the tombs, mostly of
women and young people who were buried there, one
might, if one were to die, desire the sleep they seem to
sleep. Such is the human mind, and so it peoples with
its wishes vacancy and oblivion.</p>

<p>I have told you little about Rome; but I reserve the
Pantheon, and St. Peter’s, and the Vatican, and Raphael,
for my return. About a fortnight ago I left Rome, and
Mary and C&mdash;&mdash; followed in three days, for it was
necessary to procure lodgings here without alighting at
an inn. From my peculiar mode of travelling I saw
little of the country, but could just observe that the wild
beauty of the scenery and the barbarous ferocity of the
inhabitants progressively increased. On entering Naples,
the first circumstance that engaged my attention was an
assassination. A youth ran out of a shop, pursued by a
woman with a bludgeon, and a man armed with a knife.
The man overtook him, and with one blow in the neck
laid him dead in the road. On my expressing the emotions
of horror and indignation which I felt, a Calabrian
priest, who travelled with me, laughed heartily, and<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
attempted to quiz me, as what the English call a flat.
I never felt such an inclination to beat any one. Heaven
knows I have little power, but he saw that I looked
extremely displeased, and was silent. This same man,
a fellow of gigantic strength and stature, had expressed
the most frantic terror of robbers on the road; he cried
at the sight of my pistol, and it had been with great difficulty
that the joint exertions of myself and the vetturino
had quieted his hysterics.</p>

<p>But external nature in these delightful regions contrasts
with and compensates for the deformity and
degradation of humanity. We have a lodging divided
from the sea by the royal gardens, and from our windows
we see perpetually the blue waters of the bay,
forever changing, yet forever the same, and encompassed
by the mountainous island of Capreæ, the lofty
peaks which overhang Salerno, and the woody hill of
Posilipo, whose promontories hide from us Misenum and
the lofty isle Inarime,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> which, with its divided summit,
forms the opposite horn of the bay. From the pleasant
walks of the garden we see Vesuvius; a smoke by day
and a fire by night is seen upon its summit, and the
glassy sea often reflects its light or shadow. The
climate is delicious. We sit without a fire, with the
windows open, and have almost all the productions of
an English summer. The weather is usually like what
Wordsworth calls “the first fine day of March;” sometimes
very much warmer, though perhaps it wants that
“each minute sweeter than before,” which gives an intoxicating
sweetness to the awakening of the earth from
its winter’s sleep in England. We have made two
excursions, one to Baiæ and one to Vesuvius, and we
propose to visit, successively, the islands, Pæstum,
Pompeii, and Beneventum.</p>

<p>We set off an hour after sunrise one radiant morning
in a little boat; there was not a cloud in the sky, nor a
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
wave upon the sea, which was so translucent that you
could see the hollow caverns clothed with the glaucous
sea-moss, and the leaves and branches of those delicate
weeds that pave the unequal bottom of the water. As
noon approached, the heat, and especially the light,
became intense. We passed Posilipo, and came first
to the eastern point of the bay of Puzzoli, which is within
the great bay of Naples, and which again encloses that
of Baiæ. Here are lofty rocks and craggy islets, with
arches and portals of precipice standing in the sea, and
enormous caverns, which echoed faintly with the murmur
of the languid tide. This is called La Scuola di
Virgilio. We then went directly across to the promontory
of Misenum, leaving the precipitous island of Nisida
on the right. Here we were conducted to see the Mare
Morto, and the Elysian fields; the spot on which Virgil
places the scenery of the Sixth Æneid, Though extremely
beautiful, as a lake, and woody hills, and this
divine sky must make it, I confess my disappointment.
The guide showed us an antique cemetery, where the
niches used for placing the cinerary urns of the dead
yet remain. We then coasted the bay of Baiæ to the
left, in which we saw many picturesque and interesting
ruins; but I have to remark that we never disembarked
but we were disappointed&mdash;while from the boat the
effect of the scenery was inexpressibly delightful. The
colours of the water and the air breathe over all things
here the radiance of their own beauty. After passing
the bay of Baiæ, and observing the ruins of its antique
grandeur standing like rocks in the transparent sea
under our boat, we landed to visit lake Avernus. We
passed through the cavern of the Sibyl (not Virgil’s
Sibyl), which pierces one of the hills which circumscribe
the lake, and came to a calm and lovely basin of water,
surrounded by dark woody hills, and profoundly solitary.
Some vast ruins of the temple of Pluto stand on a lawny
hill on one side of it, and are reflected in its windless
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
mirror. It is far more beautiful than the Elysian fields&mdash;but
there are all the materials for beauty in the latter,
and the Avernus was once a chasm of deadly and pestilential
vapours. About half a mile from Avernus, a
high hill, called Monte Novo, was thrown up by volcanic
fire.</p>

<p>Passing onward we came to Pozzoli, the ancient
Dicæarchea, where there are the columns remaining
of a temple to Serapis, and the wreck of an enormous
amphitheatre, changed, like the Coliseum, into a natural
hill of the overteeming vegetation. Here also is the
Solfatara, of which there is a poetical description in the
Civil War of Petronius, beginning&mdash;“Est locus,”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and
in which the verses of the poet are infinitely finer than
what he describes, for it is not a very curious place.
After seeing these things we returned by moonlight to
Naples in our boat. What colours there were in the
sky, what radiance in the evening star, and how the
moon was encompassed by a light unknown to our
regions!</p>

<p>Our next excursion was to Vesuvius. We went to
Resina in a carriage, where Mary and I mounted mules,
and C&mdash;&mdash; was carried in a chair on the shoulders of
four men, much like a member of parliament after he
has gained his election, and looking, with less reason,
quite as frightened. So we arrived at the hermitage of
San Salvador, where an old hermit, belted with rope, set
forth the plates for our refreshment.</p>

<p>Vesuvius is, after the glaciers, the most impressive
exhibition of the energies of nature I ever saw. It
has not the immeasurable greatness, the overpowering
magnificence, nor, above all, the radiant beauty of the
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
glaciers; but it has all their character of tremendous
and irresistible strength. From Resina to the hermitage
you wind up the mountain, and cross a vast stream of
hardened lava, which is an actual image of the waves of
the sea, changed into hard black stone by enchantment.
The lines of the boiling flood seem to hang in the air;
and it is difficult to believe that the billows which seem
hurrying down upon you are not actually in motion.
This plain was once a sea of liquid fire. From the
hermitage we crossed another vast stream of lava, and
then went on foot up the cone&mdash;this is the only part
of the ascent in which there is any difficulty, and that
difficulty has been much exaggerated. It is composed
of rocks of lava, and declivities of ashes; by ascending
the former and descending the latter, there is very little
fatigue. On the summit is a kind of irregular plain, the
most horrible chaos that can be imagined; riven into
ghastly chasms, and heaped up with tumuli of great
stones and cinders, and enormous rocks blackened and
calcined, which had been thrown from the volcano upon
one another in terrible confusion. In the midst stands
the conical hill from which volumes of smoke, and the
fountains of liquid fire, are rolled forth forever. The
mountain is at present in a slight state of eruption; and
a thick heavy white smoke is perpetually rolled out,
interrupted by enormous columns of an impenetrable
black bituminous vapour, which is hurled up, fold after
fold, into the sky with a deep hollow sound, and fiery
stones are rained down from its darkness, and a black
shower of ashes fell even where we sat. The lava, like
the glacier, creeps on perpetually, with a crackling sound
as of suppressed fire. There are several springs of
lava; and in one place it gushes precipitously over a
high crag, rolling down the half-molten rocks and its own
overhanging waves; a cataract of quivering fire. We
approached the extremity of one of the rivers of lava;
it is about twenty feet in breadth and ten in height; and
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
as the inclined plane was not rapid, its motion was very
slow. We saw the masses of its dark exterior surface
detach themselves as it moved, and betray the depth of
the liquid flame. In the day the fire is but slightly
seen; you only observe a tremulous motion in the air,
and streams and fountains of white sulphurous smoke.</p>

<p>At length we saw the sun sink between Capreæ and
Inarime, and, as the darkness increased, the effect of
the fire became more beautiful. We were, as it were,
surrounded by streams and cataracts of the red and
radiant fire; and in the midst, from the column of
bituminous smoke shot up into the air, fell the vast
masses of rock, white with the light of their intense
heat, leaving behind them through the dark vapour trains
of splendour. We descended by torch-light, and I
should have enjoyed the scenery on my return, but they
conducted me, I know not how, to the hermitage in a
state of intense bodily suffering, the worst effect of which
was spoiling the pleasure of Mary and C&mdash;&mdash;. Our
guides on the occasion were complete savages. You
have no idea of the horrible cries which they suddenly
utter, no one knows why, the clamour, the vociferation,
the tumult. C&mdash;&mdash; in her palanquin suffered most
from it; and when I had gone on before, they threatened
to leave her in the middle of the road, which they would
have done had not my Italian servant promised them a
beating, after which they became quiet. Nothing, however,
can be more picturesque than the gestures and the
physiognomies of these savage people. And when, in
the darkness of night, they unexpectedly begin to sing in
chorus some fragments of their wild but sweet national
music, the effect is exceedingly fine.</p>

<p>Since I wrote this I have seen the museum of this
city. Such statues! There is a Venus; an ideal shape
of the most winning loveliness. A Bacchus, more
sublime than any living being. A Satyr, making love
to a youth, in which the expressed life of the sculpture,
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
and the inconceivable beauty of the form of the youth,
overcome one’s repugnance to the subject. There are
multitudes of wonderfully fine statues found in Herculaneum
and Pompeii. We are going to see Pompeii
the first day that the sea is waveless. Herculaneum is
almost filled up; no more excavations are made; the
king bought the ground and built a palace upon it.</p>

<p>You don’t see much of Hunt. I wish you could
contrive to see him when you go to town, and ask him
what he means to answer to Lord Byron’s invitation.
He has now an opportunity, if he likes, of seeing Italy.
What do you think of joining his party, and paying us
a visit next year; I mean as soon as the reign of winter
is dissolved? Write to me your thoughts upon this.
I cannot express to you the pleasure it would give me
to welcome such a party.</p>

<p>I have depression enough of spirits and not good
health, though I believe the warm air of Naples does
me good. We see absolutely no one here.</p>

<p>Your two letters arrived within a few days of each
other, one being directed to Naples, and the other to
Livorno. They are more welcome visitors to me than
mine can be to you. I writing as from sepulchres,
you from the habitations of men yet unburied; though
the sexton, Castlereagh, after having dug their grave,
stands with his spade in his hand, evidently doubting
whether he will not be forced to occupy it himself.
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
Your news about the bank-note trials is excellent good.
Do I not recognise in it the influence of Cobbett? You
don’t tell me what occupies Parliament. I know you
will laugh at my demand, and assure me that it is indifferent.
Your pamphlet I want exceedingly to see.
Your calculations in the letter are clear, but require
much oral explanation. You know I am an infernal
arithmetician. If none but me had contemplated
“lucentemque globum lunæ, Titaniaque astra,” the
world would yet have doubted whether they were many
hundred feet higher than the mountain tops.</p>

<p>In my accounts of pictures and things, I am more
pleased to interest you than the many; and this is
fortunate, because, in the first place, I have no idea of
attempting the latter, and if I did attempt it, I should
assuredly fail. A perception of the beautiful characterizes
those who differ from ordinary men, and those
who can perceive it would not buy enough to pay
the printer. Besides, I keep no journal, and the only
records of my voyage will be the letters I send you.
The bodily fatigue of standing for hours in galleries
exhausts me; I believe that I don’t see half that I
ought, on that account. And, then, we know nobody,
and the common Italians are so sullen and stupid, it’s
impossible to get information from them. At Rome,
where the people seem superior to any in Italy, I cannot
fail to stumble on something more. O, if I had
health, and strength, and equal spirits, what boundless
intellectual improvement might I not gather in this
wonderful country! At present I write little else but
poetry, and little of that. My first act of Prometheus
is complete, and I think you would like it. I consider
poetry very subordinate to moral and political science,
and if I were well, certainly I would aspire to the latter,
for I can conceive a great work, embodying the discoveries
of all ages, and harmonizing the contending
creeds by which mankind have been ruled. Far from
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
me is such an attempt, and I shall be content, by
exercising my fancy, to amuse myself, and perhaps
some others, and cast what weight I can into the scale
of that balance, which the Giant of Arthegall holds.</p>

<p>Since you last heard from me, we have been to see
Pompeii, and are waiting now for the return of spring
weather, to visit, first, Pæstum, and then the islands;
after which we shall return to Rome. I was astonished
at the remains of this city; I had no conception of
anything so perfect yet remaining. My idea of the
mode of its destruction was this:&mdash;First, an earthquake
shattered it, and unroofed almost all its temples, and
split its columns; then a rain of light, small pumice-stones
fell; then torrents of boiling water, mixed with
ashes, filled up all its crevices. A wide, flat hill, from
which the city was excavated, is now covered by thick
woods, and you see the tombs and the theatres, the
temples and the houses, surrounded by the uninhabited
wilderness. We entered the town from the side towards
the sea, and first saw two theatres; one more magnificent
than the other, strewn with the ruins of the white
marble which formed their seats and cornices, wrought
with deep, bold sculpture. In the front, between the
stage and the seats, is the circular space, occasionally
occupied by the chorus. The stage is very narrow,
but long, and divided from this space by a narrow
enclosure parallel to it, I suppose for the orchestra.
On each side are the consuls’ boxes, and below, in the
theatre at Herculaneum, were found two equestrian
statues of admirable workmanship, occupying the same
place as the great bronze lamps did at Drury Lane.
The smallest of the theatres is said to have been comic,
though I should doubt. From both you see, as you sit
on the seats, a prospect of the most wonderful beauty.</p>

<p>You then pass through the ancient streets; they are
very narrow, and the houses rather small, but all constructed
on an admirable plan, especially for this climate.
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
The rooms are built round a court, or sometimes two,
according to the extent of the house. In the midst is
a fountain, sometimes surrounded with a portico, supported
on fluted columns of white stucco; the floor is
paved with mosaic, sometimes wrought in imitation of
vine leaves, sometimes in quaint figures, and more or
less beautiful, according to the rank of the inhabitant.
There were paintings on all, but most of them have
been removed to decorate the royal museums. Little
winged figures, and small ornaments of exquisite elegance,
yet remain. There is an ideal life in the forms of these
paintings of an incomparable loveliness, though most
are evidently the work of very inferior artists. It seems
as if, from the atmosphere of mental beauty which surrounded
them, every human being caught a splendour
not his own. In one house you see how the bed-rooms
were managed;&mdash;a small sofa was built up, where the
cushions were placed; two pictures, one representing
Diana and Endymion, the other Venus and Mars, decorate
the chamber; and a little niche, which contains
the statue of a domestic god. The floor is composed
of a rich mosaic of the rarest marbles, agate, jasper,
and porphyry; it looks to the marble fountain and the
snow-white columns, whose entablatures strew the floor
of the portico they supported. The houses have only
one story, and the apartments, though not large, are
very lofty. A great advantage results from this, wholly
unknown in our cities. The public buildings, whose
ruins are now forests as it were of white fluted columns,
and which then supported entablatures, loaded with
sculptures, were seen on all sides over the roofs of the
houses. This was the excellence of the ancients. Their
private expenses were comparatively moderate; the
dwelling of one of the chief senators of Pompeii is
elegant indeed, and adorned with most beautiful specimens
of art, but small. But their public buildings are
everywhere marked by the bold and grand designs of<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
an unsparing magnificence. In the little town of
Pompeii, (it contained about twenty thousand inhabitants,)
it is wonderful to see the number and the
grandeur of their public buildings. Another advantage,
too, is that, in the present case, the glorious
scenery around is not shut out, and that, unlike the
inhabitants of the Cimmerian ravines of modern cities,
the ancient Pompeians could contemplate the clouds
and the lamps of heaven; could see the moon rise high
behind Vesuvius, and the sun set in the sea, tremulous
with an atmosphere of golden vapour, between Inarime
and Misenum.</p>

<p>We next saw the temples. Of the temple of Æsculapius
little remains but an altar of black stone, adorned
with a cornice imitating the scales of a serpent. His
statue, in terra-cotta, was found in the cell. The temple
of Isis is more perfect. It is surrounded by a portico
of fluted columns, and in the area around it are two
altars, and many ceppi for statues; and a little chapel
of white stucco, as hard as stone, of the most exquisite
proportion; its panels are adorned with figures in bas
relief, slightly indicated, but of a workmanship the most
delicate and perfect that can be conceived. They are
Egyptian subjects, executed by a Greek artist, who has
harmonized all the unnatural extravagances of the original
conception into the supernatural loveliness of his country’s
genius. They scarcely touch the ground with their feet,
and their wind-uplifted robes seem in the place of wings.
The temple in the midst, raised on a high platform, and
approached by steps, was decorated with exquisite paintings,
some of which we saw in the museum at Portici.
It is small, of the same materials as the chapel, with a
pavement of mosaic, and fluted Ionic columns of white
stucco, so white that it dazzles you to look at it.</p>

<p>Thence through other porticos and labyrinths of walls
and columns, (for I cannot hope to detail everything to
you,) we came to the Forum. This is a large square,<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
surrounded by lofty porticos of fluted columns, some
broken, some entire, their entablatures strewed under
them. The temple of Jupiter, of Venus, and another
temple, the Tribunal, and the Hall of Public Justice,
with their forests of lofty columns, surround the Forum.
Two pedestals or altars of an enormous size, (for,
whether they supported equestrian statues, or were
the altars of the temple of Venus, before which they
stand, the guide could not tell,) occupy the lower end
of the Forum. At the upper end, supported on an
elevated platform, stands the temple of Jupiter. Under
the colonnade of its portico we sat, and pulled out our
oranges, and figs, and bread, and medlars, (sorry fare,
you will say,) and rested to eat. Here was a magnificent
spectacle. Above and between the multitudinous
shafts of the sunshining columns was seen the sea, reflecting
the purple heaven of noon above it, and supporting,
as it were, on its line the dark lofty mountains
of Sorrento, of a blue inexpressibly deep, and tinged
towards their summits with streaks of new-fallen snow.
Between was one small green island. To the right was
Capreæ, Inarime, Prochyta, and Misenum. Behind
was the single summit of Vesuvius, rolling forth volumes
of thick white smoke, whose foam-like column was sometimes
darted into the clear dark sky, and fell in little
streaks along the wind. Between Vesuvius and the
nearer mountains, as through a chasm, was seen the
main line of the loftiest Apennines, to the east. The
day was radiant and warm. Every now and then we
heard the subterranean thunder of Vesuvius; its distant
deep peals seemed to shake the very air and light of
day, which interpenetrated our frames, with the sullen
and tremendous sound. This scene was what the
Greeks beheld (Pompeii, you know, was a Greek city).
They lived in harmony with nature; and the interstices
of their incomparable columns were portals, as it were,
to admit the spirit of beauty which animates this glorious<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
universe to visit those whom it inspired. If such is
Pompeii, what was Athens? What scene was exhibited
from the Acropolis, the Parthenon, and the temples of
Hercules, and Theseus, and the Winds? The islands
and the Ægean sea, the mountains of Argolis, and the
peaks of Pindus and Olympus, and the darkness of the
Bœotian forests interspersed?</p>

<p>From the Forum we went to another public place; a
triangular portico, half inclosing the ruins of an enormous
temple. It is built on the edge of the hill overlooking
the sea. Δ That black point is the temple. In the
apex of the triangle stands an altar and a fountain, and
before the altar once stood the statue of the builder of
the portico. Returning hence, and following the consular
road, we came to the eastern gate of the city.
The walls are of enormous strength, and inclose a space
of three miles. On each side of the road beyond the
gate are built the tombs. How unlike ours! They
seem not so much hiding-places for that which must
decay, as voluptuous chambers for immortal spirits.
They are of marble, radiantly white; and two, especially
beautiful, are loaded with exquisite bas reliefs. On the
stucco-wall that incloses them are little emblematic
figures of a relief exceedingly low, of dead and dying
animals, and little winged genii, and female forms
bending in groups in some funeral office. The higher
reliefs represent, one a nautical subject, and the other a
Bacchanalian one. Within the cell stand the cinerary
urns, sometimes one, sometimes more. It is said that
paintings were found within; which are now, as has
been everything moveable in Pompeii, removed, and
scattered about in royal museums. These tombs were
the most impressive things of all. The wild woods
surround them on either side; and along the broad
stones of the paved road which divides them, you hear
the late leaves of autumn shiver and rustle in the stream
of the inconstant wind, as it were, like the step of ghosts.<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
The radiance and magnificence of these dwellings of the
dead, the white freshness of the scarcely finished marble,
the impassioned or imaginative life of the figures which
adorn them, contrast strangely with the simplicity of
the houses of those who were living when Vesuvius
overwhelmed them.</p>

<p>I have forgotten the amphitheatre, which is of great
magnitude, though much inferior to the Coliseum. I
now understand why the Greeks were such great poets;
and, above all, I can account, it seems to me, for the
harmony, the unity, the perfection, the uniform excellence,
of all their works of art. They lived in a perpetual
commerce with external nature, and nourished themselves
upon the spirit of its forms. Their theatres were all
open to the mountains and the sky. Their columns, the
ideal types of a sacred forest, with its roof of interwoven
tracery, admitted the light and wind; the odour and the
freshness of the country penetrated the cities. Their
temples were mostly upaithric; and the flying clouds,
the stars, or the deep sky, were seen above. O, but for
that series of wretched wars which terminated in the
Roman conquest of the world; but for the Christian
religion, which put the finishing stroke on the ancient
system; but for those changes that conducted Athens
to its ruin,&mdash;to what an eminence might not humanity
have arrived!</p>

<p>In a short time I hope to tell you something of the
museum of this city.</p>

<p>You see how ill I follow the maxim of Horace, at least
in its literal sense: “nil admirari”&mdash;which I should
say, “prope res est una”&mdash;to prevent there ever being
anything admirable in the world. Fortunately Plato is
of my opinion; and I had rather err with Plato than be
right with Horace.</p>

<p>At this moment I have received your letter indicating
that you are removing to London. I am very much
interested in the subject of this change, and beg you<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
would write me all the particulars of it. You will be
able now to give me perhaps a closer insight into the
politics of the times than was permitted you at Marlow.
Of H&mdash;&mdash; I have a very slight opinion. There are
rumours here of a revolution in Spain. A ship came in
twelve days from Catalonia, and brought a report that
the king was massacred; that eighteen thousand insurgents
surrounded Madrid; but that before the popular
party gained head enough seven thousand were murdered
by the inquisition. Perhaps you know all by this time.
The old king of Spain is dead here. Cobbett is a fine
ὑμενοποιος&mdash;does his influence increase or diminish?
What a pity that so powerful a genius should be combined
with the most odious moral qualities.</p>

<p>We have reports here of a change in the English
ministry&mdash;to what does it amount? for, besides my
national interest in it, I am on the watch to vindicate
my most sacred rights, invaded by the chancery court.</p>

<p>I suppose now we shall not see you in Italy this
spring, whether Hunt comes or not. It’s probable I
shall hear nothing from him for some months, particularly
if he does not come. Give me <i>ses nouvelles</i>.</p>

<p>I am under an English surgeon here, who says I have
a disease of the liver, which he will cure. We keep
horses, as this kind of exercise is absolutely essential to
my health. Elise<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> has just married our Italian servant,
and has quitted us; the man was a great rascal, and
cheated enormously: this event was very much against
our advice.</p>

<p>I wrote to you the day before our departure from
Naples. We came by slow journeys, with our own
horses, to Rome, resting one day at Mola di Gaeta, at
the inn called Villa di Cicerone, from being built on the
ruins of his Villa, whose immense substructions overhang
the sea, and are scattered among the orange-groves.
Nothing can be lovelier than the scene from the terraces
of the inn. On one side precipitous mountains, whose
bases slope into an inclined plane of olive and orange-copses&mdash;the
latter forming, as it were, an emerald sky of
leaves, starred with innumerable globes of their ripening
fruit, whose rich splendour contrasted with the deep
green foliage; on the other the sea&mdash;bounded on one
side by the antique town of Gaeta, and the other by
what appears to be an island, the promontory of Circe.
From Gaeta to Terracina the whole scenery is of the
most sublime character. At Terracina precipitous
conical crags of immense height shoot into the sky and
overhang the sea. At Albano we arrived again in sight
of Rome. Arches after arches in unending lines stretching
across the uninhabited wilderness, the blue defined
line of the mountains seen between them; masses of
nameless ruin standing like rocks out of the plain; and
the plain itself, with its billowy and unequal surface,
announced the neighbourhood of Rome. And what shall
I say to you of Rome? If I speak of the inanimate ruins,
the rude stones piled upon stones, which are the sepulchres
of the fame of those who once arrayed them with
the beauty which has faded, will you believe me insensible
to the vital, the almost breathing creations of genius yet
subsisting in their perfection? What has become, you<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
will ask, of the Apollo, the Gladiator, the Venus of the
Capitol? What of the Apollo di Belvedere, the Laocoon?
What of Raffaelle and Guido? These things are best
spoken of when the mind has drunk in the spirit of their
forms; and little indeed can I, who must devote no more
than a few months to the contemplation of them, hope
to know or feel of their profound beauty.</p>

<p>I think I told you of the Coliseum, and its impressions
on me on my first visit to this city. The next most
considerable relic of antiquity, considered as a ruin, is
the Thermæ of Caracalla. These consist of six enormous
chambers, above 200 feet in height, and each inclosing
a vast space like that of a field. There are, in addition,
a number of towers and labyrinthine recesses, hidden
and woven over by the wild growth of weeds and ivy.
Never was any desolation more sublime and lovely.
The perpendicular wall of ruin is cloven into steep
ravines filled up with flowering shrubs, whose thick
twisted roots are knotted in the rifts of the stones. At
every step the aerial pinnacles of shattered stone group
into new combinations of effect, and tower above the
lofty yet level walls, as the distant mountains change
their aspect to one travelling rapidly along the plain.
The perpendicular walls resemble nothing more than
that cliff of Bisham wood, that is overgrown with wood,
and yet is stony and precipitous&mdash;you know the one I
mean; not the chalk-pit, but the spot that has the pretty
copse of fir-trees and privet-bushes at its base, and
where H * * and I scrambled up, and you, to my infinite
discontent, would go home. These walls surround green
and level spaces of lawn, on which some elms have
grown, and which are interspersed towards their skirts
by masses of the fallen ruin, overtwined with the broad
leaves of the creeping weeds. The blue sky canopies
it, and is as the everlasting roof of these enormous
halls.</p>

<p>But the most interesting effect remains. In one of<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
the buttresses, that supports an immense and lofty
arch, which “bridges the very winds of heaven,” are
the crumbling remains of an antique winding staircase,
whose sides are open in many places to the precipice.
This you ascend, and arrive on the summit of these
piles. There grow on every side thick entangled
wildernesses of myrtle, and the myrletus, and bay, and
the flowering laurustinus, whose white blossoms are
just developed, the wild fig, and a thousand nameless
plants sown by the wandering winds. These woods
are intersected on every side by paths, like sheep
tracks through the copse-wood of steep mountains,
which wind to every part of the immense labyrinth.
From the midst rise those pinnacles and masses, themselves
like mountains, which have been seen from below.
In one place you wind along a narrow strip of weed-grown
ruin, on one side is the immensity of earth and
sky, on the other a narrow chasm, which is bounded
by an arch of enormous size, fringed by the many-coloured
foliage and blossoms, and supporting a lofty
and irregular pyramid, overgrown like itself with the
all-prevailing vegetation. Around rise other crags and
other peaks, all arrayed, and the deformity of their vast
desolation softened down, by the undecaying investiture
of nature. Come to Rome. It is a scene by which
expression is overpowered; which words cannot convey.
Still further, winding up one-half of the shattered pyramids,
by the path through the blooming copse-wood,
you come to a little mossy lawn, surrounded by the
wild shrubs; it is overgrown with anemones, wall-flowers,
and violets, whose stalks pierce the starry
moss, and with radiant blue flowers, whose names I
know not, and which scatter through the air the divinest
odour, which, as you recline under the shade of the
ruin, produces sensations of voluptuous faintness, like
the combinations of sweet music. The paths still wind
on, threading the perplexed windings, other labyrinths,<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
other lawns, and deep dells of wood, and lofty rocks,
and terrific chasms. When I tell you that these ruins
cover several acres, and that the paths above penetrate
at least half their extent, your imagination will fill
up all that I am unable to express of this astonishing
scene.</p>

<p>I speak of these things not in the order in which
I visited them, but in that of the impression which they
made on me, or perhaps chance directs. The ruins of
the ancient Forum are so far fortunate that they have
not been walled up in the modern city. They stand in
an open, lonesome place, bounded on one side by the
modern city, and the other by the Palatine Mount,
covered with shapeless masses of ruin. The tourists
tell you all about these things, and I am afraid of
stumbling on their language when I enumerate what is
so well known. There remain eight granite columns of
the Ionic order, with their entablature, of the temple
of Concord, founded by Camillus. I fear that the
immense expense demanded by these columns forbids
us to hope that they are the remains of any edifice
dedicated by that most perfect and virtuous of men. It
is supposed to have been repaired under the Eastern
Emperors; alas, what a contrast of recollections!
Near them stand those Corinthian fluted columns,
which supported the angle of a temple; the architrave
and entablature are worked with delicate sculpture.
Beyond, to the south, is another solitary column; and
still more distant, three more, supporting the wreck
of an entablature. Descending from the Capitol to the
Forum, is the triumphal arch of Septimius Severus, less
perfect than that of Constantine, though from its proportions
and magnitude, a most impressive monument.
That of Constantine, or rather of Titus, (for the relief
and sculpture, and even the colossal images of Dacian
captives, were torn by a decree of the senate from an
arch dedicated to the latter, to adorn that of this stupid<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
and wicked monster, Constantine, one of whose chief
merits consists in establishing a religion, the destroyer
of those arts which would have rendered so base a
spoliation unnecessary) is the most perfect. It is an
admirable work of art. It is built of the finest marble,
and the outline of the reliefs is in many parts as perfect
as if just finished. Four Corinthian fluted columns
support, on each side, a bold entablature, whose bases
are loaded with reliefs of captives in every attitude of
humiliation and slavery. The compartments above
express in bolder relief the enjoyment of success; the
conqueror on his throne, or in his chariot, or nodding
over the crushed multitudes, who writhe under his
horses’ hoofs, as those below express the torture and
abjectness of defeat. There are three arches, whose
roofs are panelled with fretwork, and their sides
adorned with similar reliefs. The keystone of these
arches is supported each by two winged figures of
Victory, whose hair floats on the wind of their own
speed, and whose arms are outstretched, bearing
trophies, as if impatient to meet. They look, as it
were, borne from the subject extremities of the earth,
on the breath which is the exhalation of that battle and
desolation, which it is their mission to commemorate.
Never were monuments so completely fitted to the
purpose for which they were designed, of expressing
that mixture of energy and error which is called a
triumph.</p>

<p>I walk forth in the purple and golden light of an
Italian evening, and return by star or moonlight, through
this scene. The elms are just budding, and the warm
spring winds bring unknown odours, all sweet, from the
country. I see the radiant Orion through the mighty
columns of the temple of Concord, and the mellow
fading light softens down the modern buildings of the
Capitol, the only ones that interfere with the sublime
desolation of the scene. On the steps of the Capitol<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
itself, stand two colossal statues of Castor and Pollux,
each with his horse, finely executed, though far inferior
to those of Monte Cavallo, the cast of one of which you
know we saw together in London. This walk is close
to our lodging, and this is my evening walk.</p>

<p>What shall I say of the modern city? Rome is yet
the capital of the world. It is a city of palaces and
temples, more glorious than those which any other city
contains, and of ruins more glorious than they. Seen
from any of the eminences that surround it, it exhibits
domes beyond domes, and palaces, and colonnades interminably,
even to the horizon; interspersed with
patches of desert, and mighty ruins which stand girt by
their own desolation, in the midst of the fanes of living
religions and the habitations of living men, in sublime
loneliness. St. Peter’s is, as you have heard, the loftiest
building in Europe. Externally it is inferior in architectural
beauty to St. Paul’s, though not wholly devoid
of it; internally it exhibits littleness on a large scale,
and is in every respect opposed to antique taste. You
know my propensity to admire; and I tried to persuade
myself out of this opinion&mdash;in vain; the more I see of
the interior of St. Peter’s, the less impression as a whole
does it produce on me. I cannot even think it lofty,
though its dome is considerably higher than any hill
within fifty miles of London; and when one reflects, it
is an astonishing monument of the daring energy of man.
Its colonnade is wonderfully fine, and there are two
fountains, which rise in spire-like columns of water to
an immense height in the sky, and falling on the
porphyry vases from which they spring, fill the whole
air with a radiant mist, which at noon is thronged with
innumerable rainbows. In the midst stands an obelisk.
In front is the palace-like façade of St Peter’s, certainly
magnificent; and there is produced, on the whole, an
architectural combination unequalled in the world. But
the dome of the temple is concealed, except at a very<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
great distance, by the façade and the inferior part of
the building, and that diabolical contrivance they call
an attic.</p>

<p>The effect of the Pantheon is totally the reverse of
that of St. Peter’s. Though not a fourth part of the
size, it is, as it were, the visible image of the universe;
in the perfection of its proportions, as when you regard
the unmeasured dome of heaven, the idea of magnitude
is swallowed up and lost. It is open to the sky, and
its wide dome is lighted by the ever-changing illumination
of the air. The clouds of noon fly over it, and at
night the keen stars are seen through the azure darkness,
hanging immoveably, or driving after the driving
moon among the clouds. We visited it by moonlight;
it is supported by sixteen columns, fluted and Corinthian,
of a certain rare and beautiful yellow marble, exquisitely
polished, called here <i>giallo antico</i>. Above these are the
niches for the statues of the twelve gods. This is the
only defect of this sublime temple; there ought to have
been no interval between the commencement of the
dome and the cornice, supported by the columns. Thus
there would have been no diversion from the magnificent
simplicity of its form. This improvement is alone
wanting to have completed the unity of the idea.</p>

<p>The fountains of Rome are, in themselves, magnificent
combinations of art, such as alone it were worth
coming to see. That in the Piazza Navona, a large
square, is composed of enormous fragments of rock,
piled on each other, and penetrated, as by caverns.
This mass supports an Egyptian obelisk of immense
height. On the four corners of the rock recline, in
different attitudes, colossal figures representing the four
divisions of the globe. The water bursts from the
crevices beneath them. They are sculptured with great
spirit; one impatiently tearing a veil from his eyes;
another with his hands stretched upwards. The Fontana
di Trevi is the most celebrated, and is rather a waterfall<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
than a fountain; gushing out from masses of rock, with
a gigantic figure of Neptune; and below are two river
gods, checking two winged horses, struggling up from
among the rocks and waters. The whole is not ill-conceived
nor executed; but you know not how delicate
the imagination becomes by dieting with antiquity day
after day. The only things that sustain the comparison
are Raphael, Guido, and Salvator Rosa.</p>

<p>The fountain on the Quirinal, or rather the group
formed by the statues, obelisk and the fountain, is, however,
the most admirable of all. From the Piazza
Quirinale, or rather Monte Cavallo, you see the boundless
ocean of domes, spires, and columns, which is the
City, Rome. On a pedestal of white marble rises an
obelisk of red granite, piercing the blue sky. Before
it is a vast basin of porphyry, in the midst of which
rises a column of the purest water, which collects into
itself all the overhanging colours of the sky, and breaks
them into a thousand prismatic hues and graduated
shadows&mdash;they fall together with its dashing water-drops
into the outer basin. The elevated situation of this
fountain produces, I imagine, this effect of colour. On
each side, on an elevated pedestal, stand the statues of
Castor and Pollux, each in the act of taming his horse,
which are said, but I believe wholly without authority,
to be the work of Phidias and Praxiteles. These figures
combine the irresistible energy with the sublime and
perfect loveliness supposed to have belonged to their
divine nature. The reins no longer exist, but the position
of their hands and the sustained and calm command
of their regard, seem to require no mechanical aid to
enforce obedience. The countenances at so great a
height are scarcely visible, and I have a better idea of
that of which we saw a cast together in London, than
of the other. But the sublime and living majesty of
their limbs and mien, the nervous and fiery animation
of the horses they restrain, seen in the blue sky of Italy,<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
and overlooking the city of Rome, surrounded by the
light and the music of that crystalline fountain, no cast
can communicate.</p>

<p>These figures were found at the Baths of Constantine,
but, of course, are of remote antiquity. I do not
acquiesce, however, in the practice of attributing to
Phidias, or Praxiteles, or Scopas, or some great master,
any admirable work that may be found. We find little
of what remained, and perhaps the works of these were
such as greatly surpassed all that we conceive of most
perfect and admirable in what little has escaped the
<i>deluge</i>. If I am too jealous of the honour of the Greeks,
our masters, and creators, the gods whom we should
worship,&mdash;pardon me.</p>

<p>I have said what I feel without entering into any
critical discussions of the <i>ruins</i> of Rome, and the mere
outside of this inexhaustible mine of thought and feeling.
Hobhouse, Eustace, and Forsyth, will tell all the shew-knowledge
about it&mdash;“the common stuff of the earth.”
By-the-bye, Forsyth is worth reading, as I judge from
a chapter or two I have seen. I cannot get the book
here.</p>

<p>I ought to have observed that the central arch of the
triumphal arch of Titus yet subsists, more perfect in its
proportions, they say, than any of a later date. This
I did not remark. The figures of Victory, with unfolded
wings, and each spurning back a globe with outstretched
feet, are, perhaps, more beautiful than those on either
of the others. Their lips are parted: a delicate mode
of indicating the fervour of their desire to arrive at the
destined resting-place, and to express the eager respiration
of their speed. Indeed, so essential to beauty were
the forms expressive of the exercise of the imagination
and the affections considered by <i>Greek</i> artists, that no
ideal figure of antiquity, not destined to some representation
directly exclusive of such a character, is to be
found with closed lips. Within this arch are two panelled<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
alto relievos, one representing a train of people bearing
in procession the instruments of Jewish worship, among
which is the holy candlestick with seven branches; on
the other, Titus standing in a quadriga, with a winged
Victory. The grouping of the horses, and the beauty,
correctness and energy of their delineation, is remarkable,
though they are much destroyed.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Peacock</span>,</p>
</div>

<p>I sent you yesterday a long letter, all about antique
Rome, which you had better keep for some leisure day.
I received yours, and one of Hunt’s, yesterday.&mdash;So,
you know the B&mdash;&mdash;s? I could not help considering
Mrs. B., when I knew her, as the most admirable specimen
of a human being I had ever seen. Nothing
earthly ever appeared to me more perfect than her
character and manners. It is improbable that I shall
ever meet again the person whom I so much esteemed,
and still admire. I wish, however, that when you see
her, you would tell her that I have not forgotten her,
nor any of the amiable circle once assembled round her;
and that I desire such remembrances to her, as an exile
and a <i>Pariah</i> may be permitted to address to an acknowledged
member of the community of mankind. I hear
they dined at your lodgings. But no mention of A * * *
and his wife&mdash;where were they? C * * *, though so
young when I saw her, gave indications of her mother’s
excellences; and, certainly less fascinating, is, I doubt
not, equally amiable, and more sincere. It was hardly
possible for a person of the extreme subtlety and delicacy
of Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;’s understanding and affections, to be quite
sincere and constant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_287">[Pg 287]</span></p>

<p>I am all anxiety about your I. H. affair. There are
few who will feel more hearty satisfaction at your success,
in this or any other enterprise, than I shall. Pray let
me have the earliest intelligence.</p>

<p>When shall I return to England? The Pythia has
ascended the tripod, but she replies not. Our present
plans&mdash;and I know not what can induce us to alter
them&mdash;lead us back to Naples in a month or six weeks,
where it is almost decided that we should remain until
the commencement of 1820. You may imagine when
we receive such letters as yours and Hunt’s, what this
resolution costs us&mdash;but these are not our only communications
from England. My health is materially
better. My spirits not the most brilliant in the world;
but that we attribute to our solitary situation, and,
though happy, how should I be lively? We see something
of Italian society indeed. The Romans please me
much, especially the women; who, though totally devoid
of every kind of information, or culture of the imagination,
or affections, or understanding&mdash;and, in this
respect, a kind of gentle savages&mdash;yet contrive to be
interesting. Their extreme innocence and <i>naïveté</i>, the
freedom and gentleness of their manners; the total
absence of affectation, makes an intercourse with them
very like an intercourse with uncorrupted children,
whom they resemble in loveliness as well as simplicity.
I have seen two women in society here of the highest
beauty; their brows and lips, and the moulding of the
face modelled with sculptural exactness, and the dark
luxuriance of their hair floating over their fine complexions&mdash;and
the lips&mdash;you must hear the common-places
which escape from them before they cease to be
dangerous. The only inferior part are the eyes, which,
though good and gentle, want the mazy depth of colour
behind colour, with which the intellectual women of England
and Germany entangle the heart in soul-inwoven
labyrinths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_288">[Pg 288]</span></p>

<p>This is holy week, and Rome is quite full. The
Emperor of Austria is here, and Maria Louisa is coming.
On their journey through the other cities of Italy, she
was greeted with loud acclamations, and vivas of Napoleon.
Idiots and slaves! Like the frogs in the fable,
because they are discontented with the log, they call
upon the stork, who devours them. Great festas, and
magnificent funzioni here&mdash;we cannot get tickets to all.
There are five thousand strangers in Rome, and only
room for five hundred, at the celebration of the famous
Miserere, in the Sistine chapel, the only thing I regret
we shall not be present at. After all, Rome is eternal,
and were all that <i>is</i> extinguished, that which <i>has been</i>,
the ruins and the sculptures, would remain, and Raffaelle
and Guido be alone regretted.</p>

<p>In the square of St. Peter’s there are about three
hundred fettered criminals at work, hoeing out the
weeds that grow between the stones of the pavement.
Their legs are heavily ironed, and some are chained
two by two. They sit in long rows, hoeing out the
weeds, dressed in parti-coloured clothes. Near them
sit or saunter, groups of soldiers, armed with loaded
muskets. The iron discord of those innumerable chains
clanks up into the sonorous air, and produces, contrasted
with the musical dashing of the fountains, and the deep
azure beauty of the sky, and the magnificence of the
architecture around, a conflict of sensations allied to
madness. It is the emblem of Italy&mdash;moral degradation
contrasted with the glory of nature and the arts.</p>

<p>We see no English society here; it is not probable
that we could if we desired it, and I am certain that we
should find it insupportable. The manners of the rich
English are wholly insupportable, and they assume pretences
which they would not venture upon in their own
country.&mdash;I am yet ignorant of the event of Hobhouse’s
election. I saw the last numbers were&mdash;Lamb, 4200;
and Hobhouse, 3900&mdash;14th day. There is little hope.
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
That mischievous Cobbett has divided and weakened
the interest of the popular party, so that the factions
that prey upon our country have been able to coalesce
to its exclusion. The N&mdash;&mdash;s you have not seen. I
am curious to know what kind of a girl Octavia becomes;
she promised well. Tell H&mdash;&mdash; his Melpomene is in
the Vatican, and that her attitude and drapery surpass,
if possible, the graces of her countenance.</p>

<p>My “Prometheus Unbound” is just finished, and in a
month or two I shall send it. It is a drama, with characters
and mechanism of a kind yet unattempted; and
I think the execution is better than any of my former
attempts. By-the-bye, have you seen Ollier? I never
hear from him, and am ignorant whether some verses
I sent him from Naples, entitled, I think, “Lines on
the Euganean hills,” have reached him in safety or
not. As to the Reviews, I suppose there is nothing but
abuse; and this is not hearty or sincere enough to
amuse me. As to the poem now printing,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> I lay no
stress on it one way or the other. The concluding
lines are natural.</p>

<p>I believe, my dear Peacock, that you wish us to come
back to England. How is it possible? Health, competence,
tranquillity&mdash;all these Italy permits, and England
takes away. I am regarded by all who know or hear of
me, except, I think, on the whole, five individuals, as a
rare prodigy of crime and pollution, whose look even
might infect. This is a large computation, and I don’t
think I could mention more than three. Such is the
spirit of the English abroad as well as at home.</p>

<p>Few compensate, indeed, for all the rest, and if I
were <i>alone</i> I should laugh; or if I were rich enough to
do all things, which I shall never be. Pity me for my
absence from those social enjoyments which England
might afford me, and which I know so well how to
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
appreciate. Still, I shall return some fine morning, out
of pure weakness of heart.</p>

<p>A combination of circumstances, which Mary will
explain to you, leads us back to Naples in June, or
rather the end of May, where we shall remain until the
ensuing winter. We shall take a house at Portici, or
Castel a Mare, until late in the autumn.</p>

<p>The object of this letter is to ask you to spend this
period with us. There is no society which we have
regretted or desired so much as yours, and in our solitude
the benefit of your concession would be greater
than I can express. What is a sail to Naples? It is
the season of tranquil weather and prosperous winds.
If I knew the magic that lay in any given form of words,
I would employ them to persuade; but I fear that all I
can say is, as you know with truth, we desire that you
would come&mdash;we wish to see you. You came to see
Mary at Lucca, directly I had departed to Venice. It
is not our custom, when we can help it, any more than
it is yours, to divide our pleasures.</p>

<p>What shall I say to entice you? We shall have a
piano, and some books, and&mdash;little else, beside ourselves.
But what will be most inviting to you, you will give
much, though you may receive but little pleasure.</p>

<p>But whilst I write this with more desire than hope,
yet some of that, perhaps the project may fall into your<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
designs. It is intolerable to think of your being buried
at Livorno. The success assured by Mr. Reveley’s
talents requires another scene. You may have decided
to take this summer to consider&mdash;and why not with us
at Naples, rather than at Livorno?</p>

<p>I could address, with respect to Naples, the words of
Polypheme in Theocritus, to all the friends I wish to see,
and you especially:</p>

<p>We still remain, and shall remain nearly two months
longer, at Livorno. Our house is a melancholy one,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
and only cheered by letters from England. I got your
note, in which you speak of three letters having been
sent to Naples, which I have written for. I have heard
also from H&mdash;&mdash;, who confirms the news of your success,
an intelligence most grateful to me.</p>

<p>The object of the present letter is to ask a favour of
you. I have written a tragedy, on the subject of a story
well known in Italy, and, in my conception, eminently
dramatic.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> I have taken some pains to make my play
fit for representation, and those who have already seen<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
it judge favourably. It is written without any of the
peculiar feelings and opinions which characterise my
other compositions; I having attended simply to the
impartial development of such characters, as it is probable
the persons represented really were, together with
the greatest degree of popular effect to be produced by
such a development. I send you a translation of the
Italian manuscript on which my play is founded, the
chief subject of which I have touched very delicately;
for my principal doubt, as to whether it would succeed
as an acting play, hangs entirely on the question, as to
whether such a thing as incest in this shape, however
treated, would be admitted on the stage. I think, however,
it will form no objection; considering, first, that
the facts are matter of history; and, secondly, the
peculiar delicacy with which I have treated it.</p>

<p>I am exceedingly interested in the question of whether
this attempt of mine will succeed or no. I am strongly
inclined to the affirmative at present, founding my hopes
on this, that, as a composition, it is certainly not inferior
to any of the modern plays that have been acted, with
the exception of “Remorse;”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> that the interest of its
plot is incredibly greater and more real; and that there
is nothing beyond what the multitude are contented to believe
that they can understand, either in imagery, opinion,
or sentiment. I wish to preserve a complete incognito,
and can trust to you, that whatever else you do, you
will, at least, favour me on this point. Indeed, this is
essential, deeply essential, to its success. After it had
been acted, and successfully, (could I hope such a thing,)
I would own it if I pleased, and use the celebrity it
might acquire to my own purposes.</p>

<p>What I want you to do is, to procure for me its
presentation at Covent Garden. The principal character,<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
Beatrice, is precisely fitted for Miss O’Neil, and
it might even seem written for her, (God forbid that
I should ever see her play it&mdash;it would tear my nerves
to pieces,) and, in all respects, it is fitted only for
Covent Garden. The chief male character, I confess,
I should be very unwilling that any one but Kean should
play&mdash;that is impossible, and I must be contented with
an inferior actor. I think you know some of the people
of that theatre, or, at least, some one who knows them,
and when you have read the play, you may say enough
perhaps to induce them not to reject it without consideration&mdash;but
of this, perhaps, if I may judge from the
tragedies which they have accepted, there is no danger
at any rate.</p>

<p>Write to me as soon as you can on this subject,
because it is necessary that I should present it, or,
if rejected by the theatre, print it this coming season;
lest somebody else should get hold of it, as the story,
which now exists only in manuscript, begins to be
generally known among the English. The translation
which I send you, is to be prefixed to the play, together
with a print of Beatrice. I have a copy of her picture
by Guido, now in the Colonna palace at Rome&mdash;the
most beautiful creature you can conceive.</p>

<p>Of course, you will not show the manuscript to any
one&mdash;and write to me by return of post, at which time
the play will be ready to be sent.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I expect soon to write again, and it shall be a less
selfish letter. As to Ollier, I don’t know what has been
published, or what has arrived at his hands.&mdash;My
“Prometheus,” though ready, I do not send till I know
more.</p>

Ever yours, most faithfully,<br />

<p>We are now on the point of leaving this place for
Florence, where we have taken pleasant apartments for
six months, which brings us to the first of April, the
season at which new flowers and new thoughts spring
forth upon the earth and in the mind. What is then
our destination is yet undecided. I have not yet seen
Florence, except as one sees the outside of the streets;
but its <i>physiognomy</i> indicates it to be a city, which,
though the ghost of a republic, yet possesses most amiable
qualities. I wish you could meet us there in the spring,
and we would try to muster up a “lièta brigata,” which,
leaving behind them the pestilence of remembered
misfortunes, might act over again the pleasures of the
Interlocutors in Boccaccio. I have been lately reading
this most divine writer. He is, in a high sense of the
word, a poet, and his language has the rhythm and
harmony of verse. I think him not equal certainly to
Dante or Petrarch, but far superior to Tasso and Ariosto,
the children of a later and of a colder day. I consider
the three first as the productions of the vigour of the
infancy of a new nation&mdash;as rivulets from the same
spring as that which fed the greatness of the republics
of Florence and Pisa, and which checked the influence
of the German emperors; and from which, through
obscurer channels, Raffaelle and Michael Angelo drew
the light and the harmony of their inspiration. When
the second-rate poets of Italy wrote, the corrupting
blight of tyranny was already hanging on every bud of
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
genius. Energy, and simplicity, and unity of idea, were
no more. In vain do we seek, in the finest passages
of Ariosto and Tasso, any expression which at all
approaches in this respect to those of Dante and
Petrarch. How much do I admire Boccaccio! What
descriptions of nature are those in his little introductions
to every new day! It is the morning of life stripped of
that mist of familiarity which makes it obscure to us.
Boccaccio seems to me to have possessed a deep sense
of the fair ideal of human life, considered in its social
relations. His more serious theories of love agree
especially with mine. He often expresses things lightly
too, which have serious meanings of a very beautiful
kind. He is a moral casuist, the opposite of the
Christian, stoical, ready-made, and worldly system of
morals. Do you remember one little remark, or rather
maxim of his, which might do some good to the
common narrow-minded conceptions of love,&mdash;“Bocca
bacciata non perde ventura; anzi rinnuova, come fa la
luna”?</p>

<p>We expect Mary to be confined towards the end of
October. The birth of a child will probably retrieve her
from some part of her present melancholy depression.</p>

<p>It would give me much pleasure to know Mr. Lloyd.
Do you know, when I was in Cumberland, I got Southey
to borrow a copy of Berkeley from him, and I remember
observing some pencil notes in it, probably written by
Lloyd, which I thought particularly acute. One, especially,
struck me as being the assertion of a doctrine, of
which even then I had long been persuaded, and on
which I had founded much of my persuasions, as regarded
the imagined cause of the universe&mdash;“Mind
cannot create, it can only perceive.” Ask him if he
remembers having written it. Of Lamb you know my
opinion, and you can bear witness to the regret which I
felt, when I learned that the calumny of an enemy had
deprived me of his society whilst in England.&mdash;Ollier
told me that the Quarterly are going to review me. I<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
suppose it will be a pretty &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and as I am acquiring
a taste for humour and drollery, I confess I am curious
to see it. I have sent my “Prometheus Unbound” to
P.; if you ask him for it he will show it you. I think
it will please you.</p>

<p>Whilst I went to Florence, Mary wrote, but I did
not see her letter.&mdash;Well, good b’ye. Next Monday I
shall write to you from Florence. Love to all.</p>

<p>The regret we feel at our absence from you persuades
me that it is a state which cannot last, and which, so
long as it must last, will be interrupted by some intervals,
one of which is destined to be, your all coming to
visit us here. Poor Oscar! I feel a kind of remorse
to think of the unequal love with which two animated
beings regard each other, when I experience no such
sensations for him, as those which he manifested for
us. His importunate regret is, however, a type of ours,
as regards you. Our memory&mdash;if you will accept so

until this money comes from London, though I am sure
that it will and must come; unless, indeed, my banker
has broke, and then it will be my loss, not Henry’s&mdash;a
little delay will mend the matter. I would then write
instantly to London an effectual letter, and by return of
post all would be set right&mdash;it would then be a thing
easily set straight&mdash;but if it were not, you know me too
well not to know that there is no personal suffering or
degradation, or toil, or anything that can be named,
with which I do not feel myself bound to support this
enterprise of Henry. But all this rhodomontade only
shows how correct Mr. Bielby’s advice was about the
discipline necessary for my imagination. No doubt
that all will go on with mercantile and common-place
exactness, and that you will be spared the suffering,
and I the virtue, incident to some untoward event.</p>

<p>I am anxious to hear of Mr. Gisborne’s return, and
I anticipate the surprise and pleasure with which he<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
will learn that a resolution has been taken which leaves
you nothing to regret in that event. It is with unspeakable
satisfaction that I reflect that my entreaties and
persuasions overcame your scruples on this point, and
that whatever advantage shall accrue from it will belong
to you, whilst any reproach due to the imprudence of
such an enterprise, must rest on me. I shall thus share
the pleasure of success, and bear the blame and loss,
(if such a thing were possible,) of a reverse; and what
more can a man, who is a friend to another, desire for
himself? Let us believe in a kind of optimism, in which
we are our own gods. It is best that Mr. Gisborne
should have returned; it is best that I should have over-persuaded
you and Henry; it is best that you should
all live together, without any more solitary attempts;
it is best that this one attempt should have been made,
otherwise, perhaps, one thing which is best might not
have occurred; and it is best that we should think
all this for the best, even though it is not; because
Hope, as Coleridge says, is a solemn duty, which we
owe alike to ourselves and to the world&mdash;a worship
to the spirit of good within, which requires, before it
sends that inspiration forth, which impresses its likeness
upon all that it creates, devoted and disinterested
homage.</p>

<p>A different scene is this from that in which you made
the chief character of our changing drama. We see no
one, as usual. Madame M&mdash;&mdash; is quiet, and we
only meet her now and then, by chance. Her daughter,
not so fair, but I fear as cold, as the snowy Florimel in
Spenser, is in and out of love with C&mdash;&mdash; as the winds
happen to blow; and C&mdash;&mdash;, who, at the moment I
happen to write, is in a high state of transitory contentment,
is setting off to Vienna in a day or two.</p>

<p>My £100, from what mistake remains to be explained,
has not yet arrived, and the banker here is going to
advance me £50, on my bill at three months&mdash;all additional<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
facilitation, should any such be needed, for the
steam-boat. I have yet seen little of Florence. The
gallery I have a design of studying piece-meal; one of
my chief objects in Italy being the observing in statuary
and painting, the degree in which, and the rules according
to which, that ideal beauty, of which we have so
intense yet so obscure an apprehension, is realised in
external forms.</p>

<p>Adieu&mdash;I am anxious for Henry’s first letter. Give
to him, and take to yourself those sentiments, whatever
they may be, with which you know that I cannot cease
to regard you.</p>

<p class="right">

<p>I had forgotten to say that I should be very much
obliged to you, if you would contrive to send the Cencis,
which are at the printer’s, to England, by the next ship.
I forgot it in the hurry of departure.&mdash;I have just heard
from Peacock, saying, that he don’t think that my
tragedy will do, and that he don’t much like it. But
I ought to say, to blunt the edge of his criticism, that
he is a nursling of the exact and superficial school in
poetry.</p>

<p>If Mr. G. is returned, send the “Prometheus” with
them.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28" class="label">[28]</a> Shelley set on foot the building of a steam-boat, to ply between
Marseilles, Genoa, and Leghorn. Such an enterprise promised
fortune to his friend who undertook to build it, and the anticipation
filled him with delight. An unforeseen complication of circumstances
caused the design to be abandoned, when already far advanced
towards completion.&mdash;[<i>Note by Mrs. Shelley.</i>]</p>

<p>An extract from a letter of Mrs. Gisborne to Mrs. Shelley is perhaps
necessary to explain further some portion of Shelley’s letter:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Now, I will tell you the news of the steam-boat. The contract
was drawn and signed the day after your departure; the vessel to
be complete, and launched, fit in every respect for the sea, excepting
the finishing of the cabin, for 260 sequins. We have every reason
to believe that the work will be well executed, and that it is an
excellent bargain. Henry and Frankfort go on not only with
vigour, but with fury; the lower part of the house is filled with
models prepared for casting, forging, &amp;c. We have procured the
wood for the frame from the shipbuilder on credit, so that Frankfort
can go on with his work; but I am sorry to say, that from this time
the general progress of the work will be retarded for want of cash.
The boilers might now be going on contemporaneously with the
casting, but I know that at present there is no remedy for this evil.
Every person concerned is making exertions, and is in a state of
anxiety to see the quick result of this undertaking. I have advanced
about 140 crowns, but prudence prohibits me from going any
farther.</p>

<p>“Henry will write to Mr. Shelley when the works are in a greater
state of forwardness: in the mean time, he sends his best love to his
good friends, patron and patroness.”</p>

</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Henry</span>,</p>
</div>

<p>So it seems <i>I</i> am to begin the correspondence, though
I have more to ask than to tell.</p>

<p>You know our bargain; you are to write me <i>uncorrected</i>
letters, just as the words come, so let me have<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
them&mdash;I like coin from the mint&mdash;though it may be a
little rough at the edges;&mdash;clipping is penal according
to our statute.</p>

<p>In the first place listen to a reproach; you ought to
have sent me an acknowledgment of my last billet. I
am very happy to hear from Mr. Gisborne, and he
knows well enough how to interest me himself, not to
need to rob me of an occasion of hearing from you.
Let you and I try if we cannot be as punctual and
business-like as the best of them. But no clipping and
coining, if you please.</p>

<p>Now take this that I say in a light just so serious as
not to give you pain. In fact, my dear fellow, my
motive in soliciting your correspondence, and that
flowing from your own mind, and clothed in your own
words, is, that you may begin to accustom to discipline
yourself in the only practice of life in which you appear
deficient. You know that you are writing to a person
persuaded of all the confidence and respect due to your
powers in those branches of science to which you have
addicted yourself; and you will not permit a false shame
with regard to the mere mechanical arrangement of
words to over-balance the advantage arising from the
free communication of ideas. Thus you will become
day by day more skilful in the management of that
instrument of their communication, on which the attainment
of a person’s just rank in society depends. Do
not think me arrogant. There are subjects of the highest
importance in which you are far better qualified to instruct
me, than I am qualified to instruct you on this
subject.</p>

<p>Well, how goes on all? The boilers, the keel of the
boat, and the cylinder, and all the other elements of
that soul which is to guide our “monstruo de fuego y
agua” over the sea? Let me hear news of their birth,
and how they thrive after they are born. And is the
money arrived at Mr. Webb’s? Send me an account<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
of the number of crowns you realise; as I think we had
better, since it is a transaction in this country, keep our
accounts in money of this country.</p>

<p>We have rains enough to set the mills going, which
are essential to your great iron bar. I suppose it is at
present either made or making.</p>

<p>My health is better so long as the scirocco blows,
and, but for my daily expectation of Mary’s confinement,
I should have been half tempted to have come to see
you. As it is, I shall wait till the boat is finished. On
the subject of your actual and your expected progress,
you will certainly allow me to hear from you.</p>

<p>Give my kindest regards to your mother and Mr.
Gisborne&mdash;tell the latter, whose billet I have neglected
to answer, that I did so, under the idea of addressing
him in a post or two on a subject which gives me considerable
anxiety about you all. I mean the continuance
of your property in the British funds at this crisis
of approaching revolution. It is the business of a friend
to say what he thinks without fear of giving offence;
and, if I were not a friend, argument is worth its market-price
anywhere.</p>

<p>I receive this morning the strange and unexpected
news, that my bill of £200 has been returned to Mr.
Webb protested. Ultimately this can be nothing but
delay, as I have only drawn from my banker’s hands so
much as to leave them still in possession of £80, and<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
this I positively know, and can prove by documents.
By return of post, for I have not only written to my
banker, but to private friends, no doubt Henry will be
enabled to proceed. Let him meanwhile do all that can
be done.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, to save time, could not money be obtained
temporarily, at Livorno, from Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;, or Mr. G&mdash;&mdash;,
or any of your acquaintance, on my bills at three or
six months, indorsed by Mr. Gisborne and Henry, so
that he may go on with his work? If a month is of
consequence, think of this.</p>

<p>Be of good cheer, Madonna mia, all will go well.
The inclosed is for Henry, and was written before this

<i>Florence, Nov. 6, 1819.</i>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Friends</span>,</p>
</div>

<p>I have just finished a letter of five sheets on Carlile’s
affair,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and am in hourly expectation of Mary’s confinement,
you will imagine an excuse for my silence.</p>

<p>I forbear to address you, as I had designed, on the
subject of your income as a public creditor of the
English government, as it seems you have not the
exclusive management of your funds; and the peculiar
circumstances of the delusion are such that none but a
very few persons will ever be brought to see its instability
but by the experience of loss. If I were to convince<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
you, Henry would probably be unable to convince his
uncle. In vindication, however, of what I have already
said, allow me to turn your attention to England at this
<i>hour</i>.</p>

<p>In order to meet the national expenses, or rather that
some approach towards meeting them might seem to be
made, a tax of £3,000,000 was imposed. The first
consequence of this has been a <i>defalcation</i> in the revenue
at the rate of £3,600,000 a-year. Were the country in
the most tranquil and prosperous state, the minister,
in such a condition of affairs, must reduce the interest
of the national debt, or add to it; a process which
would only insure the greater ultimate reduction of the
interest. But the people are nearly in a state of insurrection,
and the least unpopular noblemen perceive the
necessity of conducting a spirit, which it is no longer
possible to oppose. For submitting to this necessity&mdash;which,
be assured, the haughty aristocrats unwillingly
did&mdash;Lord Fitzwilliam has been degraded from his
situation of Lord Lieutenant. An additional army of
11,500 men has received orders to be organised. Everything
is preparing for a bloody struggle, in which, if
the ministers succeed, they will assuredly diminish the
interest of the national debt, for no combination of the
heaviest tyranny can raise the taxes for its payment.
If the people conquer, the public creditor will equally
suffer; for it is monstrous to imagine that they will
submit to the perpetual inheritance of a double aristocracy.
They will perhaps find some crown and church
lands, and appropriate the tithes to make a kind of
compensation to the public creditor. They will confiscate
the estates of their political enemies. But all this
will not pay a tenth part of their debt. The existing
government, atrocious as it is, is the surest party to
which a public creditor may attach himself. He may
reason that <i>it may last my time</i>, though in the event the
ruin is more complete than in the case of a popular
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
revolution. I know you too well to believe you capable
of arguing in this manner; I only reason on how things
stand.</p>

<p>Your income may be reduced from £210 to £150,
and then £100, and then by the issue of immense
quantities of paper to save the immediate cause of one
of the conflicting parties, to any value however small;
or the source of it may be cut off at once. The
ministers had, I doubt not, long since determined to
establish an arbitrary government; and if they had not
determined so, they have now entangled themselves in
that consequence of their instinct as rulers, and if they
recede they must perish. They are, however, not receding,
and we are on the eve of great actions.</p>

<p>Kindest regards to Henry. I hope he is not stopped
for want of money, as I shall assuredly send him what
he wants in a month from the date of my last letter.
I received his letter from Pistoia, and have no other
criticism to make on it, except the severest&mdash;that it is
too short. How goes on Portuguese&mdash;and Theocritus?
I have deserted the odorous gardens of literature, to
journey across the great sandy desert of politics; not,
as you may imagine, without the hope of finding some
enchanted paradise. In all probability, I shall be
overwhelmed by one of the tempestuous columns which
are forever traversing, with the speed of a storm, and
the confusion of a chaos, that pathless wilderness.
You meanwhile will be lamenting in some happy oasis
that I do not return. This is out-Calderonizing Muley.
We have had lightning and rain here in plenty. I
like the Cascini very much, where I often walk alone,
watching the leaves, and the rising and falling of the
Arno. I am full of all kinds of literary plans.</p>

<p>I have been lately voyaging in a sea without my
pilot, and although my sail has often been torn, my
boat become leaky, and the log lost, I have yet sailed
in a kind of way from island to island; some of craggy
and mountainous magnificence, some clothed with moss
and flowers, and radiant with fountains, some barren
deserts. <i>I have been reading Calderon without you.</i>
I have read the “Cisma de Ingalaterra,” the “Cabellos
de Absolom,” and three or four others. These pieces,
inferior to those we read, at least to the “Principe
Constante,” in the splendour of particular passages, are
perhaps superior in their satisfying completeness. The
“Cabellos de Absolom” is full of the deepest and
tenderest touches of nature. Nothing can be more
pathetically conceived than the character of old David,
and the tender and impartial love, overcoming all insults
and all crimes, with which he regards his conflicting
and disobedient sons. The incest scene of Amon and
Tamar is perfectly tremendous. Well may Calderon
say in the person of the former&mdash;</p>

<p>Incest is, like many other incorrect things, a very
poetical circumstance. It may be the excess of love
or hate. It may be the defiance of everything for the
sake of another, which clothes itself in the glory of the
highest heroism, or it may be that cynical rage which,
confounding the good and the bad in existing opinions,
breaks through them for the purpose of rioting in selfishness
and antipathy. Calderon, following the Jewish historians,
has represented Amon’s action in the basest<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
point of view&mdash;he is a prejudiced savage, acting what
he abhors, and abhorring that which is the unwilling

<p>I envy you the first reading of Theocritus. Were
not the Greeks a glorious people? What is there, as
Job says of the Leviathan, like unto them? If the army
of Nicias had not been defeated under the walls of
Syracuse; if the Athenians had, acquiring Sicily, held
the balance between Rome and Carthage, sent garrisons
to the Greek colonies in the south of Italy, Rome might
have been all that its intellectual condition entitled it
to be, a tributary, not the conqueror of Greece; the
Macedonian power would never have attained to the
dictatorship of the civilized states of the world. Who
knows whether, under the steady progress which philosophy
and social institutions would have made, (for, in
the age to which I refer, their progress was both rapid
and secure,) among a people of the most perfect physical
organization, whether the Christian religion would have
arisen, or the barbarians have overwhelmed the wrecks
of civilization which had survived the conquest and
tyranny of the Romans? What, then, should we have
been? As it is, all of us who are worth anything, spend
our manhood in unlearning the follies, or expiating the
mistakes of our youth. We are stuffed full of prejudices;
and our natural passions are so managed, that
if we restrain them we grow intolerant and precise,
because we restrain them not according to reason, but
according to error; and if we do not restrain them, we
do all sorts of mischief to ourselves and others. Our
imagination and understanding are alike subjected to
rules the most absurd;&mdash;so much for Theocritus and
the Greeks.

<p>“It is probable that you will be earnest to employ the sacred
talisman of language. To acquire these you are now necessitated
to sacrifice many hours of the time, when, instead of being conversant
with particles and verbs, your nature incites you to contemplation
and inquiry concerning the objects which they conceal.
You desire to enjoy the beauties of eloquence and poetry&mdash;to
sympathise in the original language with the institutors and martyrs
of ancient freedom. The generous and inspiriting examples of
philosophy and virtue you desire intimately to know and feel; not
as mere facts detailing names, and dates, and motions of the human
body, but clothed in the very language of the actors,&mdash;that language
dictated by and expressive of the passions and principles that
governed their conduct. Facts are not what we want to know in
poetry, in history, in the lives of individual men, in satire, or in
panegyric. They are the mere divisions, the arbitrary points on
which we hang, and to which we refer those delicate and evanescent
hues of mind, which language delights and instructs us in
precise proportion as it expresses. What is a translation of Homer
into English? A person who is ignorant of Greek need only look
at Paradise Lost or the tragedy of Lear translated into French, to
obtain an analogical conception of its worthless and miserable
inadequacy. Tacitus, or Livius, or Herodotus, are equally undelightful
and uninstructive in translation. You require to know
and to be intimate with those persons who have acted a distinguished
part to benefit, to enlighten, or even to pervert and injure humankind.
Before you can do this, four years are yet to be consumed
in the discipline of the ancient languages, and those of modern
Europe, which you only imperfectly know, and which conceal from
your intimacy such names as Ariosto, Tasso, Petrarch, and
Macchiavelli; or Goethe, Schiller, Wieland, &amp;c. The French
language you, like every other respectable woman, already know;
and if the great name of Rousseau did not redeem it, it would have
been perhaps as well that you had remained entirely ignorant
of it.”</p>

hope, in a few posts, to remit the necessary money for
the completion. Meanwhile, are not those portions of
the work which can be done without expense, saving
time in their progress? Do you think you lose much
money or time by this delay?</p>

<p>All that you say of the alteration in the form of the
boat strikes me, though one of the multitude in this
respect, as improvement. I long to get aboard her, and
be an unworthy partaker in the glory of the astonishment
of the Livornese, when she returns from her cruise
round Melloria. When do you think she will be fit
for sea?</p>

<p>Your volcanic description of the birth of the cylinder
is very characteristic of you, and of it.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> One might<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
imagine God, when he made the earth, and saw the
granite mountains and flinty promontories flow into their
craggy forms, and the splendour of their fusion filling
millions of miles of the void space, like the tail of a
comet, so looking, so delighting in his work. God sees
his machine spinning round the sun, and delights in its
success, and has taken out patents to supply all the
suns in space with the same manufacture. Your boat
will be to the ocean of water, what this earth is to the
ocean of ether&mdash;a prosperous and swift voyager.</p>

<p>When shall we see you all? <i>You</i> not, I suppose,
till your boat is ready to sail&mdash;and then, if not before,
I must, of course, come to Livorno. Our plans for the
winter are yet scarcely defined; they tend towards our
spending February and March at Pisa, where our communications
will not be so distant, nor so epistolary.
C&mdash;&mdash; left us a week ago, not without many lamentations,
as all true lovers pay on such occasions. He is<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>

<p><a id="Footnote_31" href="#FNanchor_31" class="label">[31]</a> The passage in Mr. Reveley’s letter referred to by Shelley was
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="right">
“<i>Friday, 12th Nov.</i>
</p>

<p>“The event is now past&mdash;both the steam cylinder and air-pump
were cast at three o’clock this afternoon. At two o’clock this
morning I repaired to the mill to see that the preliminary operations,
upon which the ultimate success of a <i>fount</i> greatly depends, were
conducted with proper attention. The moulds are buried in a pit,
made close, before the mouth of the furnace, so that the melted
metal, when the plug is driven in, may run easily into them, and
fill up the vacant space left between the core and the shell, in order
to form the desired cylinders. The fire was lighted in the furnace
at nine, and in three hours the metal was fused. At three o’clock it
was ready to cast, the fusion being remarkably rapid, owing to the
perfection of the furnace. The metal was also heated to an extreme
degree, boiling with fury, and seeming to dance with the pleasure of
running into its proper form. The plug was struck, and a massy
stream of a bluish dazzling whiteness filled the moulds in the
twinkling of a shooting star. The castings will not be cool enough
to be drawn up till to-morrow afternoon; but, to judge from all
appearances, I expect them to be perfect.</p>

<p class="right">
“<i>Saturday, 13th Nov.</i>
</p>

<p>“They have been excavated and drawn up. I have examined
them and found them really perfect; they are massive and strong
to bear any usage and sea-water, in <i>sæcula sæculorum</i> I am now
going on gently with the brass-work, which does not require any
immediate expenses, and which I attend to entirely myself. I have
no workmen about me at present.”</p>

<p>You see, as I said, it only amounts to delay, all this
abominable entanglement. I send you 484 dollars, or
ordinary francesconi, I suppose, but you will tell me
what you receive in Tuscan money, if they are not&mdash;the
produce of £100. So my heart is a little lightened,
which, I assure you, was heavy enough until this moment,
on your account. I write to Messrs. Ward to pay you.</p>

<p>I have received no satisfactory letter from my bankers,
but I must expect it every week&mdash;or, at least, in a month
from this date, when I will not fail to transmit you the
remainder of what may be necessary.</p>

<p>Every body here is talking of a steam-ship which is
building at Leghorn; one person said, as if he knew
the whole affair, that he was waiting in Tuscany to take
his departure to Naples in it. Your name has not, to
my knowledge, been mentioned. I think you would do
well to encourage this publicity.</p>

<p>I have better health than I have known for a long
time&mdash;ready for any stormy cruise. When will the ship
be ready to sail? We have been feeding ourselves
with the hope that Mr. Gisborne and your mother would
have paid us their promised visit. I did not even hope,
perhaps not even wish, that you should, until the engine
is finished. My regret at this failure has several times
impelled me to go to Leghorn&mdash;but I have always<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
resisted the temptation. Ask them, entreat them, from
me, to appoint some early day. We have a bed and
room, and every thing prepared.</p>

<p>I suffered more pain than it would be manly to
confess, or than you can easily conceive, from that
wretched uncertainty about the money. At last, however,
it is certain that you will encounter no further
check in the receiving supplies, and a weight is taken
from my spirits, which, in spite of many other causes of
discomfort, makes itself known to have been a heavy
load, by the lightness which I now feel in writing
to you.</p>

<p>So the steam-boat will take three months to finish?
The vernal equinox will be over by that time, and the
early wakening of the year have paved the Mediterranean
with calm. Among other circumstances to
regret in this delay, it is so far well that our first
cruise will be made in serene weather.</p>

<p>I send you enclosed a mandate for 396 francesconi,
which is what M. Torlonia incorrectly designates a
hundred pounds&mdash;but as we count in the money of the
country, that need make no difference to us.</p>

<p>I have just finished an additional act to “Prometheus,”

<p>I write to you thus early, because I have determined
to accept of your kind offer about the correction
of “Prometheus.” The bookseller makes difficulties
about sending the proofs to me, and to whom else can
I so well entrust what I am so much interested in having
done well; and to whom would I prefer to owe the
recollection of an additional kindness done to me? I
enclose you two little papers of corrections and additions;&mdash;I
do not think you will find any difficulty in interpolating
them into their proper places.</p>

<p>Well, how do you like London, and your journey;
the Alps in their beauty and their eternity; Paris in its
slight and transitory colours; and the wearisome plains
of France&mdash;and the <i>moral</i> people with whom you drank
tea last night? Above all, <i>how</i> are you? And of the
last question, believe me, we are now most anxiously
waiting for a reply&mdash;until which I will say nothing, nor<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
ask anything. I rely on the journal with as much security
as if it were already written.</p>

<p>I am just returned from a visit to Leghorn, Casciano,
and your old fortress at Sant’ Elmo. I bought the vases
you saw for about twenty sequins less than Micale asked,
and had them packed up, and, by the polite assistance
of your friend, Mr. Guebhard, sent them on board. I
found your Giuseppe very useful in all this business.
He got me tea and breakfast, and I slept in your house,
and departed early the next morning for Casciano.
Everything seems in excellent order at Casa Ricci&mdash;garden,
pigeons, tables, chairs, and beds. As I did not
find my bed sealed up, I left it as I found it. What a
glorious prospect you had from the windows of Sant’
Elmo! The enormous chain of the Apennines, with its
many-folded ridges, islanded in the misty distance of
the air; the sea, so immensely distant, appearing as at
your feet; and the prodigious expanse of the plain of
Pisa, and the dark green marshes lessened almost to a
strip by the height of the blue mountains overhanging
them. Then the wild and unreclaimed fertility of the
foreground, and the chesnut trees, whose vivid foliage
made a sort of resting-place to the sense before it darted
itself to the jagged horizon of this prospect. I was altogether
delighted. I had a respite from my nervous
symptoms, which was compensated to me by a violent
cold in the head. There was a tradition about you at
Sant’ Elmo&mdash;<i>An English family that had lived here in
the time of the French</i>. The doctor, too, at the Bagni,
knew you. The house is in a most dilapidated condition,
but I suppose all that is curable.</p>

<p>We go to the Bagni next month&mdash;but still direct to
Pisa as safest. I shall write to you the <i>ultimates</i> of my
commission in my next letter. I am undergoing a
course of the Pisan baths, on which I lay no singular
stress&mdash;but they soothe. I ought to have peace of mind,
leisure, tranquillity; this I expect soon. Our anxiety<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
about Godwin is very great, and any information that
you could give a day or two earlier than he might,
respecting any decisive event in his law-suit, would be a
great relief. Your impressions about Godwin (I speak
especially to Madonna mia, who had known him before,)
will especially interest me. You know that added years
only add to my admiration of his intellectual powers,
and even the moral resources of his character. Of my
other friends I say nothing. To see Hunt is to like
him; and there is one other recommendation which he
has to you, he is my friend. To know H&mdash;&mdash;, if any
one can know him, is to know something very unlike,
and inexpressibly superior, to the great mass of men.</p>

<p>Will Henry write me an adamantine letter, flowing,
not like the words of Sophocles, with honey, but molten
brass and iron, and bristling with wheels and teeth? I
saw his steam-boat asleep under the walls. I was afraid
to waken it, and ask it whether it was dreaming of him,
for the same reason that I would have refrained from
awakening Ariadne, after Theseus had left her&mdash;unless
I had been Bacchus.</p>

<p>I am to a certain degree indifferent as to the reply to
our last proposal, and, therefore, will not allude to it.
Permit me only on subjects of this nature to express
one sentiment, which you would have given me credit
for, even if not expressed. Let no considerations of <i>my</i>
interest, or any retrospect to the source from which the
funds were supplied, modify your decision as to returning<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
and pursuing or abandoning the adventure of the
steam-engine. My object was solely your true advantage,
and it is when I am baffled of this, by any attention
to a mere form, that I shall be ill requited. Nay, more,
I think it for your interest, should you obtain almost
whatever situation for Henry, to accept Clementi’s proposal,
and remain in England;&mdash;not without accepting
it, for it does no more than balance the difference of
expense between Italy and London; and if you have
any trust in the justice of my moral sense, and believe
that in what concerns true honour and virtuous conduct
in life, I am an experienced counsellor, you will not
hesitate&mdash;these things being equal&mdash;to accept this proposal.
The opposition I made, while you were in Italy,
to the abandonment of the steam-boat project, was
founded, you well know, on the motives which have influenced
everything that ever has guided, or ever will
guide, anything that I can do or say respecting you.
I thought it against Henry’s interest. I think it now
against his interest that he and you should abandon
your prospects in England. As to us&mdash;we are uncertain
people, who are chased by the spirits of our destiny from
purpose to purpose, like clouds by the wind.</p>

<p>There is one thing more to be said. If you decide
to remain in England, assuredly it would be foolish to
return. Your journey would cost you between £100
and £200, a sum far greater than you could expect to
save by the increased price by which you would sell
your things. Remit the matter to me, and I will cast
off my habitual character, and attend to the minutest
points. With Mr. G&mdash;&mdash;’s, devil take his name, I can’t
write it&mdash;you know who’s, assistance, all this might be
accomplished in such a manner as to save a very considerable
sum. Though I shall suffer from your decision
in the proportion as your society is delightful to me, I
cannot forbear expressing my persuasion, that the time,
the expense, and the trouble of returning to Italy, if<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
your ultimate decision be to settle in London, ought
all to be spared. A year, a month, a week, at Henry’s
age, and with his purposes, ought not to be unemployed.
It was the depth with which I felt this truth, which
impelled me to incite him to this adventure of the steam-boat.</p>

and a terrible slaughter, amounting, it is said, to four
thousand men, ensued. The event, however, was as it
should be. Sicily, like Naples, is free. By the brief
and partial accounts of the Florence paper, it appears
that the enthusiasm of the people was prodigious, and
that the women fought from the houses, raining down
boiling oil on the assailants.</p>

Italy. The best thing we can do is to save money, and,
if things take a decided turn, (which I am convinced
they will at last, but not perhaps for two or three
years,) it will be time for me to assert my rights, and
preserve my annuity. Meanwhile, another event may

It is certain, by private letters from merchants, that a

populace on the Tuileries still continued when the last
accounts came away. At Naples the constitutional
party have declared to the Austrian minister, that if the

would be to put to death <i>all</i> the members of the royal
family&mdash;a necessary and most just measure, when the

<p>Should you cast your eye on the signature of this
letter before you read the contents, you might imagine
that they related to a slanderous paper which appeared
in your Review some time since. I never notice
anonymous attacks. The wretch who wrote it has
doubtless the additional reward of a consciousness of
his motives, besides the thirty guineas a sheet, or whatever
it is that you pay him. Of course you cannot be
answerable for all the writings which you edit, and <i>I</i>
certainly bear you no ill-will for having edited the abuse
to which I allude&mdash;indeed, I was too much amused
by being compared to Pharaoh, not readily to forgive
editor, printer, publisher, stitcher, or any one, except
the despicable writer, connected with something so exquisitely
entertaining. Seriously speaking, I am not in
the habit of permitting myself to be disturbed by what
is said or written of me, though, I dare say, I may be
condemned sometimes justly enough. But I feel, in
respect to the writer in question, that “I am there
sitting, where he durst not soar.”</p>

<p>The case is different with the unfortunate subject of
this letter, the author of Endymion, to whose feelings
and situation I entreat you to allow me to call your
attention. I write considerably in the dark; but if it
is Mr. Gifford that I am addressing, I am persuaded
that in an appeal to his humanity and justice, he will
acknowledge the <i>fas ab hoste doceri</i>. I am aware that
the first duty of a Reviewer is towards the public, and I
am willing to confess that Endymion is a poem considerably<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
defective, and that, perhaps, it deserved as much
censure as the pages of your Review record against it;
but, not to mention that there is a certain contemptuousness
of phraseology from which it is difficult for a
critic to abstain, in the review of Endymion, I do not
think that the writer has given it its due praise. Surely
the poem, with all its faults, is a very remarkable production
for a man of Keats’s age, and the promise of
ultimate excellence is such as has rarely been afforded
even by such as have afterwards attained high literary
eminence. Look at book ii. line 833, &amp;c., and book iii.
line 113 to 120&mdash;read down that page, and then again
from line 193. I could cite many other passages, to
convince you that it deserved milder usage. Why it
should have been reviewed at all, excepting for the
purpose of bringing its excellences into notice, I cannot
conceive, for it was very little read, and there was no
danger that it should become a model to the age of
that false taste, with which I confess that it is replenished.</p>

<p>Poor Keats was thrown into a dreadful state of mind
by this review, which, I am persuaded, was not written
with any intention of producing the effect, to which it
has, at least, greatly contributed, of embittering his
existence, and inducing a disease from which there are
now but faint hopes of his recovery. The first effects
are described to me to have resembled insanity, and it
was by assiduous watching that he was restrained from
effecting purposes of suicide. The agony of his sufferings
at length produced the rupture of a blood-vessel in
the lungs, and the usual process of consumption appears
to have begun. He is coming to pay me a visit in
Italy; but I fear that unless his mind can be kept
tranquil, little is to be hoped from the mere influence
of climate.</p>

<p>But let me not extort anything from your pity. I
have just seen a second volume, published by him<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
evidently in careless despair. I have desired my bookseller
to send you a copy, and allow me to solicit your
especial attention to the fragment of a poem entitled
“Hyperion,” the composition of which was checked
by the Review in question. The great proportion of
this piece is surely in the very highest style of poetry.
I speak impartially, for the canons of taste to which
Keats has conformed in his other compositions are the
very reverse of my own. I leave you to judge for
yourself: it would be an insult to you to suppose that
from motives, however honourable, you would lend
yourself to a deception of the public.</p>

<p>Our ducking last night has added fire, instead of
quenching the nautical ardour which produced it; and
I consider it a good omen in any enterprise, that it
begins in evil: as being more probable that it will end
in good. I hope <i>you</i> have not suffered from it. I am
rather feverish, but very well as to the side, whence I
expected the worst consequences. I send you directions
for the complete equipment of our boat, since you have
so kindly promised to undertake it. In putting into
execution, a little more or less expense in so trifling
an affair, is to be disregarded. I need not say that
the approaching season invites expedition. You can
put her in hand immediately, and write the day on

<p>The rullock, or place for the oar, ought not to be
placed where the oar-pins are now, but ought to be
nearer to the mast; as near as possible, indeed, so
that the rower has room to sit. In addition let a false

deep at the stern, and to decrease towards the prow.
It may be as thin as you please.</p>

There is little, I allow, in a strict sense, to be called

<p>We anxiously expect your arrival at the Baths; but
as I am persuaded that you will spend as much time
with us as you can save from your necessary occupations
before your departure, I will forbear to vex you
with importunity. My health does not permit me to<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
spend many hours from home. I have been engaged
these last days in composing a poem on the death of
Keats, which will shortly be finished; and I anticipate
the pleasure of reading it to you, as some of the very
few persons who will be interested in it and understand
it. It is a highly-wrought <i>piece of art</i>, and perhaps
better, in point of composition, than anything I have
written.</p>

<p>I have obtained a purchaser for some of the articles
of your three lists, a catalogue of which I subjoin. I

scourged out of the world.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> I do not think that

<p>As it is, I have finished my Elegy;<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> and this day I
send it to the press at Pisa. You shall have a copy
the moment it is completed. I think it will please
you. I have dipped my pen in consuming fire for his
destroyers; otherwise the style is calm and solemn.</p>

<p>Pray, when shall we see you? Or are the streams of
Helicon less salutary than sea-bathing for the nerves?
Give us as much as you can before you go to England,
and rather divide the term than not come soon.</p>

<p>Mrs. * * * wishes that none of the books, desk,

should be sent, one by one, by Pepi. Address them to
<i>me</i> at her house. She desired me to have them addressed
to <i>me</i>, why I know not.</p>

<p>A droll circumstance has occurred. Queen Mab, a
poem written by me when very young, in the most
furious style, with long notes against Jesus Christ, and
God the Father, and the king, and bishops, and marriage,
and the devil knows what, is just published by
one of the low booksellers in the Strand, against my
wish and consent, and all the people are at loggerheads
about it. H. S.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> gives me this account. You may
imagine how much I am amused. For the sake of a
dignified appearance, however, and really because I
wish to protest against all the bad poetry in it, I have
given orders to say that it is all done against my desire,
and have directed my attorney to apply to Chancery for
an injunction, which he will not get.</p>

<p>I am pretty ill, I thank you, just now; but I hope
you are better.</p>

<p>I am fully repaid for the painful emotions from which
some verses of my poem sprung, by your sympathy and
approbation&mdash;which is all the reward I expect&mdash;and as
much as I desire. It is not for me to judge whether, in<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
the high praise your feelings assign me, you are right or
wrong. The poet and the man are two different natures;
though they exist together, they may be unconscious of
each other, and incapable of deciding on each other’s
powers and efforts by any reflex act. The decision of
the cause, whether or no <i>I</i> am a poet, is removed
from the present time to the hour when our posterity
shall assemble; but the court is a very severe one, and
I fear that the verdict will be, “Guilty&mdash;death!”</p>

<p>I shall not return this evening; nor, unless I have
better success, to-morrow. I have seen many houses,
but very few within the compass of our powers; and,
even in those which seem to suit, nothing is more difficult
than to bring the proprietors to terms. I congratulate
myself on having taken the season in time, as there is
great expectation of Florence being full next winter.
I shall do my utmost to return to-morrow evening.
You may expect me about ten or eleven o’clock, as
I shall purposely be late, to spare myself the excessive
heat.</p>

<p>The Gisbornes (four o’clock, Tuesday,) are just set
out in a diligence-and-four, for Bologna. They have
promised to write from Paris. I spent three hours this
morning principally in the contemplation of the Niobe,<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
and of a favourite Apollo; all worldly thoughts and
cares seem to vanish from before the sublime emotions
such spectacles create; and I am deeply impressed with
the great difference of happiness enjoyed by those who
live at a distance from these incarnations of all that the
finest minds have conceived of beauty, and those who can
resort to their company at pleasure. What should we
think if we were forbidden to read the great writers who
have left us their works? And yet to be forbidden to
live at Florence or Rome, is an evil of the same kind, of
scarcely less magnitude.</p>

<p>I am delighted to hear that the W.’s are with you.
I am convinced that Williams must persevere in the use
of the doccia. Give my most affectionate remembrances
to them. I shall know all the houses in Florence, and
can give W. a good account of them all. You have not
sent my passport, and I must get home as I can. I
suppose you did not receive my note.</p>

<p>I grudge my sequins for a carriage; but I have
suffered from the sun and the fatigue, and dare not
expose myself to that which is necessary for house-hunting.</p>

about daybreak; the old horse stumbled, and threw me

hedge. My angular figure stuck where it was pitched;
but my vetturino’s spherical form rolled fairly to the

<p>I arrived last night at ten o’clock, and sat up talking
with Lord Byron until five this morning. I then went
to sleep, and now awake at eleven, and having despatched
my breakfast as quick as possible, mean to devote the
interval until twelve, when the post departs, to you.</p>

<p>Lord Byron is very well, and was delighted to see
me. He has in fact completely recovered his health,<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
and lives a life totally the reverse of that which he led
at Venice. He has a permanent sort of liaison with
Contessa Giuccioli, who is now at Florence, and seems
from her letters to be a very amiable woman. She is
waiting there until something shall be decided as to
their emigration to Switzerland or stay in Italy; which
is yet undetermined on either side. She was compelled
to escape from the Papal territory in great haste, as
measures had already been taken to place her in a convent,
where she would have been unrelentingly confined
for life. The oppression of the marriage contract, as
existing in the laws and opinions of Italy, though less
frequently exercised, is far severer than that of England.
I tremble to think of what poor Emilia is destined to.</p>

<p>Lord Byron had almost destroyed himself in Venice:
his state of debility was such that he was unable to
digest any food, he was consumed by hectic fever, and
would speedily have perished, but for this attachment,
which has reclaimed him from the excesses into which
he threw himself from carelessness and pride, rather
than taste. Poor fellow! he is now quite well, and
immersed in politics and literature. He has given me
a number of the most interesting details on the former
subject, but we will not speak of them in a letter.
Fletcher is here, and as if like a shadow, he waxed
and waned with the substance of his master: Fletcher
also has recovered his good looks, and from amidst the
unseasonable grey hairs, a fresh harvest of flaxen locks
put forth.</p>

<p>We talked a great deal of poetry, and such matters
last night; and as usual differed, and I think more than
ever. He affects to patronize a system of criticism fit
for the production of mediocrity, and although all his
fine poems and passages have been produced in defiance
of this system, yet I recognise the pernicious effects of
it in the Doge of Venice; and it will cramp and limit
his future efforts however great they may be, unless he<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
gets rid of it. I have read only parts of it, or rather
he himself read them to me, and gave me the plan of
the whole.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Lord Byron has also told me of a circumstance that
shocks me exceedingly; because it exhibits a degree of
desperate and wicked malice for which I am at a loss
to account. When I hear such things my patience
and my philosophy are put to a severe proof, whilst
I refrain from seeking out some obscure hiding-place,
where the countenance of man may never meet me
more.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Imagine my despair of
good, imagine how it is possible that one of so weak
and sensitive a nature as mine can run further the
gauntlet through this hellish society of men. <i>You</i>
should write to the Hoppners a letter refuting the
charge, in case you believe, and know, and can prove
that it is false; stating the grounds and proofs of your
belief. I need not dictate what you should say; nor,
I hope, inspire you with warmth to rebut a charge,
which you only can effectually rebut. If you will
send the letter to me here, I will forward it to the
Hoppners. Lord Byron is not up, I do not know the
Hoppners’ address, and I am anxious not to lose a
post.</p>

<p>I wrote to you yesterday, and I begin another
letter to-day, without knowing exactly when I can send
it, as I am told the post only goes once a week. I
dare say the subject of the latter half my letter gave
you pain, but it was necessary to look the affair in the<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
face, and the only satisfactory answer to the calumny
must be given by you, and could be given by you
alone. This is evidently the source of the violent
denunciations of the <i>Literary Gazette</i>, in themselves
contemptible enough, and only to be regarded as
effects, which show us their cause, which until we put
off our mortal nature, we never despise&mdash;that is the
belief of persons who have known and seen you, that
you are guilty of crimes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After having sent my letter to the post yesterday, I
went to see some of the antiquities of this place, which
appear to be remarkable. This city was once of vast
extent, and the traces of its remains are to be found
more than four miles from the gate of the modern
town. The sea, which once came close to it, has now
retired to the distance of four miles, leaving a melancholy
extent of marshes, interspersed with patches of
cultivation, and towards the sea shore with pine forests,
which have followed the retrocession of the Adriatic,
and the roots of which are actually washed by its
waves. The level of the sea and of this tract of
country correspond so nearly, that a ditch dug to a few
feet in depth is immediately filled up with sea water.
All the ancient buildings have been choked up to the
height of from five to twenty feet by the deposit of the
sea, and of the inundations, which are frequent in the
winter. I went in Lord Byron’s carriage, first to the
Chiesa San Vitale, which is certainly one of the most
ancient churches in Italy. It is a rotunda supported
upon buttresses and pilasters of white marble; the ill
effect of which is somewhat relieved by an interior row
of columns. The dome is very high and narrow. The
whole church, in spite of the elevation of the soil, is
very high for its breadth, and is of a very peculiar
and striking construction. In the section of one of the<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
large tables of marble with which the church is lined,
they showed me the <i>perfect figure</i>, as perfect as if it
had been painted, of a capuchin friar, which resulted
merely from the shadings and the position of the stains
in the marble. This is what may be called a pure
anticipated cognition of a Capuchin.</p>

<p>I then went to the tomb of Theodosius, which has
now been dedicated to the Virgin, without however
any change in its original appearance. It is about
a mile from the present city. This building is more
than half overwhelmed by the elevated soil, although
a portion of the lower story has been excavated, and
is filled with brackish and stinking waters, and a sort
of vaporous darkness, and troops of prodigious frogs.
It is a remarkable piece of architecture, and without
belonging to a period when the ancient taste yet survived,
bears nevertheless a certain impression of that
taste. It consists of two stories; the lower supported
on Doric arches, and pilasters, and a simple entablature.
The other circular within, and polygonal outside,
and roofed with one single mass of ponderous
stone, for it is evidently one, and Heaven alone knows
how they contrived to lift it to that height. It is
a sort of flattish dome, rough-wrought within by the
chisel, from which the Northern conquerors tore the
plates of silver that adorned it, and polished without,
with things like handles appended to it, which were
also wrought out of the solid stone, and to which I
suppose the ropes were applied to draw it up. You
ascend externally into the second story by a flight of
stone-steps, which are modern.</p>

<p>The next place I went to was a church called <i>la
Chiesa di Sant’ Appollinare</i>, which is a Basilica, and
built by one, I forget whom, of the Christian Emperors;
it is a long church, with a roof like a barn, and
supported by twenty-four columns of the finest marble,
with an altar of jasper, and four columns of jasper and<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
giallo antico, supporting the roof of the tabernacle, which
are said to be of immense value. It is something like
that church (I forget the name of it) we saw at Rome,
<i>fuore delle mure</i>. I suppose the emperor stole these
columns, which seem not at all to belong to the place
they occupy. Within the city, near the church of San
Vitale, there is to be seen the tomb of the Empress
Galla Placidia, daughter of Theodosius the Great, together
with those of her husband Constantius, her brother
Honorius, and her son Valentinian&mdash;all Emperors. The
tombs are massy cases of marble, adorned with rude
and tasteless sculpture of lambs, and other Christian
emblems, with scarcely a trace of the antique. It seems
to have been one of the first effects of the Christian
religion, to destroy the power of producing beauty in
art. These tombs are placed in a sort of vaulted
chamber, wrought over with rude mosaic, which is said
to have been built in 1300. I have yet seen no more
of Ravenna.</p>

<p class="right">
<i>Friday.</i><br />
</p>

<p>We ride out in the evening, through the pine forests
which divide this city from the sea. Our way of life is
this, and I have accommodated myself to it without
much difficulty:&mdash;Lord Byron gets up at two, breakfasts;
we talk, read, &amp;c., until six; then we ride, and dine at
eight; and after dinner sit talking till four or five in the
morning. I get up at twelve, and am now devoting the
interval between my rising and his, to you.</p>

<p>Lord Byron is greatly improved in every respect.
In genius, in temper, in moral views, in health, in happiness.
The connexion with la Guiccioli has been an
inestimable benefit to him. He lives in considerable
splendour, but within his income, which is now about
£4000 a year, £100 of which he devotes to purposes
of charity. He has had mischievous passions, but these
he seems to have subdued, and he is becoming, what
he should be, a virtuous man. The interest which he<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
took in the politics of Italy, and the actions he performed
in consequence of it, are subjects not fit to be <i>written</i>,
but are such as will delight and surprise you. He is
not yet decided to go to Switzerland&mdash;a place, indeed,
little fitted for him: the gossip and the cabals of those
anglicised coteries would torment him, as they did
before, and might exasperate him into a relapse of
libertinism, which he says he plunged into not from
taste, but despair. La Guiccioli and her brother (who
is Lord Byron’s friend and confidant, and acquiesces
perfectly in her connexion with him) wish to go to
Switzerland; as Lord Byron says, merely from the
novelty of the pleasure of travelling. Lord Byron prefers
Tuscany or Lucca, and is trying to persuade them
to adopt his views. He has made <i>me</i> write a long letter
to her to engage her to remain&mdash;an odd thing enough
for an utter stranger to write on subjects of the utmost
delicacy to his friend’s mistress. But it seems destined
that I am always to have some active part in everybody’s
affairs whom I approach. I have set down in lame
Italian the strongest reasons I can think of against the
Swiss emigration&mdash;to tell you the truth, I should be
very glad to accept, as my fee, his establishment in
Tuscany. Ravenna is a miserable place; the people
are barbarous and wild, and their language the most
infernal patois that you can imagine. He would be, in
every respect, better among the Tuscans. I am afraid
he would not like Florence, on account of the English
there.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is Lucca, Florence, Pisa, Siena, and I think
nothing more. What think you of Prato, or Pistoia,
for him?&mdash;no Englishman approaches those towns; but
I am afraid no house could be found good enough for
him in that region.</p>

<p>He has read to me one of the unpublished cantos of
Don Juan, which is astonishingly fine. It sets him not<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
only above, but far above, all the poets of the day&mdash;every
word is stamped with immortality. I despair of
rivalling Lord Byron, as well I may, and there is no
other with whom it is worth contending. This canto
is in the style, but totally, and sustained with incredible
ease and power, like the end of the second canto. There
is not a word which the most rigid assertor of the dignity
of human nature would desire to be cancelled. It
fulfils, in a certain degree, what I have long preached
of producing&mdash;something wholly new and relative to the
age, and yet surpassingly beautiful. It may be vanity,
but I think I see the trace of my earnest exhortations
to him to create something wholly new. He has finished
his <i>life</i> up to the present time, and given it to Moore,
with liberty for Moore to sell it for the best price he
can get, with condition that the bookseller should publish
it after his death. Moore has sold it to Murray for
<i>two thousand pounds</i>. I have spoken to him of Hunt,
but not with a direct view of demanding a contribution;
and, though I am sure that if asked it would not be
refused&mdash;yet, there is something in me that makes it
impossible. Lord Byron and I are excellent friends,
and were I reduced to poverty, or were I a writer who
had no claims to a higher station than I possess&mdash;or did
I possess a higher than I deserve, we should appear in all
things as such, and I would freely ask him any favour.
Such is not the case. The demon of mistrust and pride
lurks between two persons in our situation, poisoning
the freedom of our intercourse. This is a tax and a
heavy one, which we must pay for being human. I
think the fault is not on my side, nor is it likely, I being
the weaker. I hope that in the next world these things
will be better managed. What is passing in the heart
of another rarely escapes the observation of one who is
a strict anatomist of his own.</p>

<p>Write to me at Florence, where I shall remain a day
at least, and send me letters, or news of letters. How<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
is my little darling? And how are you, and how do
you get on with your book? Be severe in your corrections,
and expect severity from me, your sincere admirer.
I flatter myself you have composed something unequalled
in its kind, and that, not content with the honours of
your birth and your hereditary aristocracy, you will add
still higher renown to your name. Expect me at the
end of my appointed time. I do not think I shall be
detained. Is C. with you, or is she coming? Have
you heard anything of my poor Emilia, from whom I
got a letter the day of my departure, saying, that her
marriage was deferred for a <i>very short</i> time, on account
of the illness of her sposo. How are the Williamses,
and Williams especially? Give my very kindest love
to them.</p>

<p>Lord Byron has here splendid apartments in the
house of his mistress’s husband, who is one of the
richest men in Italy. <i>She</i> is divorced, with an allowance
of 1200 crowns a-year, a miserable pittance from
a man who has 120,000 a-year.&mdash;Here are two monkeys,
five cats, eight dogs, and ten horses, all of whom
(except the horses) walk about the house like the
masters of it. <i>Tita</i> the Venetian is here, and operates
as my valet; a fine fellow, with a prodigious black beard,
and who has stabbed two or three people, and is one of
the most good-natured looking fellows I ever saw.</p>

<p>We have good rumours of the Greeks here, and a
Russian war. I hardly wish the Russians to take any
part in it. My maxim is with Æschylus:&mdash;τὸ δυσσεβὲς&mdash;μετὰ
μὲν πλείονα τίκτει, σφετέρᾳ δ’ ἐίκοτα γεννᾷ. There
is a Greek exercise for you. How should slaves produce
anything but tyranny&mdash;even as the seed produces the
plant?</p>

<p>You will be surprised to hear that Lord Byron has
decided upon coming to <i>Pisa</i>, in case he shall be able,
with my assistance, to prevail upon his mistress to
remain in Italy, of which I think there is little doubt.
He wishes for a large and magnificent house, but he
has furniture of his own, which he would send from
Ravenna. Inquire if any of the large palaces are to be
let. We discussed Prato, Pistoia, Lucca, &amp;c., but they
would not suit him so well as Pisa, to which, indeed, he
shows a decided preference. So let it be! Florence
he objects to, on account of the prodigious influx of
English.</p>

<p>I don’t think this circumstance ought to make any
difference in our own plans with respect to this winter in
Florence, because we could easily reassume our station,
with the spring, at Pugnano or the baths, in order to
enjoy the society of the noble lord. But do you consider
this point, and write to me your full opinion, at
the Florence post-office.</p>

<p>I suffer much to-day from the pain in my side,
brought on, I believe, by this accursed water. In other
respects, I am pretty well, and my spirits are much improved;
they had been improving, indeed, before I left
the baths, after the deep dejection of the early part of
the year.</p>

<p>I am reading Anastasius.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> One would think that
Lord Byron had taken his idea of the three last cantos
of Don Juan from this book. That, of course, has
nothing to do with the merit of this latter, poetry having
nothing to do with the invention of facts. It is a very<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>
powerful and very entertaining novel, and a faithful
picture, they say, of modern Greek manners. I have
read Lord Byron’s letter to Bowles&mdash;some good things&mdash;but
he ought not to write prose criticism.</p>

<p>You will receive a long letter, sent with some of
Lord Byron’s, express to Florence.</p>

<p>I write this in haste.&mdash;Yours most affectionately,</p>

<p>I write, though I doubt whether I shall not arrive
before this letter; as the post only leaves Ravenna once
a week, on Saturdays, and as I hope to set out to-morrow<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>
evening by the courier. But as I must necessarily stay
a day at Florence, and as the natural incidents of
travelling may prevent me from taking my intended
advantage of the couriers, it is probable that this letter
will arrive first. Besides, as I will explain, I am not
<i>yet</i> quite my own master. But that by and bye. I do
not think it necessary to tell you of my impatience to
return to you and my little darling, or the disappointment
with which I have prolonged my absence from you.
I am happy to think that you are not quite alone.</p>

<p>Lord Byron is still decided upon Tuscany; and such
is his impatience, that he has desired me&mdash;as if I should
not arrive in time&mdash;to write to you to inquire for the
best unfurnished palace in Pisa, and to enter upon a
treaty for it. It is better not to be on the Lung’ Arno;
but, in fact, there is no such hurry, and as I shall see
you so soon, it is not worth while to trouble yourself
about it.</p>

<p>I told you I had written by Lord Byron’s desire to la
Guiccioli, to dissuade her and her family from Switzerland.
Her answer is this moment arrived, and my
representation seems to have reconciled them to the
unfitness of that step. At the conclusion of a letter,
full of all the fine things she says she has heard of
me, is this request, which I transcribe;&mdash;“<i>Signore&mdash;la
vostra bontà mi fa ardita di chiedervi un favore&mdash;me
lo accorderete voi? Non partite da Ravenna senza
Milord.</i>” Of course, being now, by all the laws of knighthood,
captive to a lady’s request, I shall only be at
liberty on <i>my parole</i>, until Lord Byron is settled at Pisa.
I shall reply, of course, that the <i>boon</i> is granted, and
that if her lover is reluctant to quit Ravenna, after I
have made arrangements for receiving him at Pisa, I
am bound to place myself in the same situation as now,
to assail him with importunities to rejoin her. Of this
there is, fortunately, no need; and I need not tell you
there is no fear that this chivalric submission of mine<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>
to the great general laws of antique courtesy, against
which I never rebel, and which is my religion, should
interfere with my quick returning, and long remaining
with you, dear girl.</p>

<p>I have seen Dante’s tomb, and worshipped the sacred
spot. The building and its accessories are comparatively
modern, but, the urn itself, and the tablet of
marble, with his portrait in relief, are evidently of equal
antiquity with his death. The countenance has all the
marks of being taken from his own; the lines are
strongly marked, far more than the portraits, which,
however, it resembles; except, indeed, the eye, which
is half closed, and reminded me of Pacchiani. It was
probably taken after death. I saw the library, and
some specimens of the earliest illuminated printing from
the press of Fust. They are on vellum, and of an
execution little inferior to that of the present day.</p>

<p>We ride out every evening as usual, and practise
pistol-shooting at a pumpkin; and I am not sorry to
observe that I approach towards my noble friend’s
exactness of aim. The water here is villainous, and I
have suffered tortures; but I now drink nothing but
alcalescent water, and am much relieved. I have the
greatest trouble to get away; and Lord Byron, as a
reason for my stay, has urged, that without either me
or the Guiccioli, he will certainly fall into his old habits.
I then talk, and he listens to reason; and I earnestly
hope that he is too well aware of the terrible and degrading
consequences of his former mode of life, to
be in danger from the short interval of temptation
that will be left him. Lord Byron speaks with great
kindness and interest of you, and seems to wish to
see you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_345">[Pg 345]</span></p>

<p class="right">
<i>Ravenna, Thursday.</i>
</p>

<p>I have received your letter with that to Mrs. Hoppner.
I do not wonder, my dearest friend, that you should
have been moved. I was at first, but speedily regained
the indifference which the opinion of anything, or anybody,
except our own consciousness, amply merits; and
day by day shall more receive from me. I have not
recopied your letter; such a measure would destroy its
authenticity, but have given it to Lord Byron, who has
engaged to send it with his own comments to the
Hoppners. People do not hesitate, it seems, to make
themselves panders and accomplices to slander, for the
Hoppners had exacted from Lord Byron that these
accusations should be concealed from <i>me</i>. Lord Byron
is not a man to keep a secret, good or bad; but in
openly confessing that he has not done so, he must
observe a certain delicacy, and therefore he wished to
send the letter himself, and indeed this adds weight to
your representations. Have you seen the article in the
Literary Gazette on me? They evidently allude to
some story of this kind&mdash;however cautious the Hoppners
have been in preventing the calumniated person from
asserting his justification, you know too much of the
world not to be certain that this was the utmost limit
of their caution. So much for nothing.</p>

<p>Lord Byron is immediately coming to Pisa. He will
set off the moment I can get him a house. Who would
have imagined this? Our first thought ought to be &mdash;&mdash;,
our second our own plans. The hesitation in your
letter about Florence has communicated itself to me;
although I hardly see what we can do about Horace
Smith, to whom our attentions are so due, and would
be so useful. If I do not arrive before this long scrawl,
write something to Florence to decide me. I shall
certainly not, without strong reasons, at present <i>sign</i>
the agreement for the old codger’s house; although the
extreme beauty and fitness of the place, should we
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
decide on Florence, might well overbalance the objection
of your deaf visitor. One thing&mdash;with Lord Byron and
the people we know at Pisa, we should have a security
and protection, which seems to be more questionable
at Florence. But I do not think that this consideration
ought to weigh. What think you of remaining at Pisa?
The Williamses would probably be induced to stay there
if we did; Hunt would certainly stay, at least this
winter, near us, should he emigrate at all; Lord Byron
and his Italian friends would remain quietly there; and
Lord Byron has certainly a great regard for us&mdash;the
regard of such a man is worth&mdash;<i>some</i> of the tribute we
must pay to the base passions of humanity in any intercourse
with those within their circle; he is better worth
it than those on whom we bestow it from mere custom.
The &mdash;&mdash; are there, and as far as solid affairs are concerned,
are my friends. * * * At Pisa I need not
distil my water&mdash;if I <i>can</i> distil it anywhere. Last
winter I suffered less from my painful disorder than the
winter I spent at Florence. The arguments for Florence
you know, and they are very weighty; judge (<i>I know
you like the job</i>) which scale is overbalanced.</p>

<p>My greatest content would be utterly to desert all
human society. I would retire with you and our child
to a solitary island in the sea, would build a boat, and
shut upon my retreat the flood-gates of the world. I
would read no reviews, and talk with no authors. If I
dared trust my imagination, it would tell me that there
are one or two chosen companions beside yourself
whom I should desire. But to this I would not listen&mdash;where
two or three are gathered together, the devil
is among them. And good, far more than evil impulses,
love, far more than hatred, has been to me, except as
you have been its object, the source of all sorts of mischief.
So on this plan, I would be <i>alone</i>, and would
devote either to oblivion or to future generations, the
overflowings of a mind which, timely withdrawn from<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
the contagion, should be kept fit for no baser object.
But this it does not appear that we shall do.</p>

<p>The other side of the alternative (for a medium ought
not to be adopted) is to form for ourselves a society
of our own class, as much as possible in intellect, or in
feelings; and to connect ourselves with the interests of
that society. Our roots never struck so deeply as at
Pisa, and the transplanted tree flourishes not. People
who lead the lives which we led until last winter, are
like a family of Wahabee Arabs, pitching their tent in
the midst of London. We must do one thing or the
other&mdash;for yourself, for our child, for our existence. The
calumnies, the sources of which are probably deeper
than we perceive, have ultimately, for object, the depriving
us of the means of security and subsistence.
You will easily perceive the gradations by which calumny
proceeds to pretext, pretext to persecution, and persecution
to the ban of fire and water. It is for this, and
not because this or that fool, or the whole court of
fools, curse and rail, that calumny is worth refuting or
chastising.</p>

<p>I cannot express the pain and disappointment with
which I learn the change in your plans, no less than the
afflicting cause of it. Florence will no longer have any
attractions for me this winter, and I shall contentedly
sit down in this humdrum Pisa, and refer to hope and
to chance the pleasure I had expected from your society
this winter. What shall I do with your packages,
which have now, I believe, all arrived at Guebhard’s at
Leghorn? Is it not possible that a favourable change
in Mrs. Smith’s health might produce a corresponding<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
change in your determinations, and would it, or would
it not, be premature to forward the packages to your
present residence, or to London? I will pay every possible
attention to your instructions in this regard.</p>

<p>I had marked down several houses in Florence, and
one especially on the Arno, a most lovely place, though
they asked rather more than perhaps you would have
chosen to pay&mdash;yet nothing approaching to an English
price.&mdash;I do not yet entirely give you up.&mdash;Indeed, I
should be sorry not to hope that Mrs. Smith’s state
of health would not soon become such, as to remove
your principal objection to this delightful climate. I
have not, with the exception of three or four days,
suffered in the least from the heat this year. Though,
it is but fair to confess, that my temperament approaches
to that of the salamander.</p>

<p>We expect Lord Byron here in about a fortnight. I
have just taken the finest palace in Pisa for him, and
his luggage, and his horses, and all his train, are, I
believe, already on their way hither. I dare say you
have heard of the life he led at Venice, rivalling the
wise Solomon almost, in the number of his concubines.
Well, he is now quite reformed, and is leading a most
sober and decent life, as <i>cavaliere servente</i> to a very
pretty Italian woman, who has already arrived at Pisa,
with her father and her brother (such are the manners
of Italy), as the jackals of the lion. He is occupied in
forming a new drama, and, with views which I doubt
not will expand as he proceeds, is determined to write
a series of plays, in which he will follow the French
tragedians and Alfieri, rather than those of England and
Spain, and produce something new, at least, to England.
This seems to me the wrong road; but genius like his
is destined to lead and not to follow. He will shake off
his shackles as he finds they cramp him. I believe he
will produce something very great; and that familiarity
with the dramatic power of human nature will soon<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
enable him to soften down the severe and unharmonising
traits of his “Marino Faliero.” I think you know
Lord Byron personally, or is it your brother? If the
latter, I know that he wished particularly to be introduced
to you, and that he will sympathise, in some degree, in
this great disappointment which I feel in the change, or,
as I yet hope, in the prorogation of your plans.</p>

<p>I am glad you like “Adonais,” and, particularly, that
you do not think it metaphysical, which I was afraid it
was. I was resolved to pay some tribute of sympathy
to the unhonoured dead, but I wrote, as usual, with a
total ignorance of the effect that I should produce.&mdash;I
have not yet seen your pastoral drama; if you have
a copy, could you favour me with it? It will be six
months before I shall receive it from England. I have
heard it spoken of with high praise, and I have the
greatest curiosity to see it.</p>

<p>The Gisbornes promised to buy me some books in
Paris, and I had asked you to be kind enough to
advance them what they might want to pay for them.
I cannot conceive why they did not execute this little
commission for me, as they knew how very much I
wished to receive these books by the same conveyance
as the filtering-stone. Dare I ask you to do me the
favour to buy them? <i>A complete edition of the works
of Calderon</i>, and the French translation of Kant, a
German Faust, and to add the Nympholept?<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>&mdash;I am
indifferent as to a little more or less expense, so that I
may have them immediately. I will send you an order
on Paris for the amount, together with the thirty-two
francs you were kind enough to pay for me.</p>

<p>All public attention is now centred on the wonderful
revolution in Greece. I dare not, after the events of last
winter hope that slaves can become freemen so cheaply;
yet I know one Greek of the highest qualities, both of<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>
courage and conduct, the Prince Mavrocordato, and if
the rest be like him, all will go well.&mdash;The news of
this moment is, that the Russian army has orders to
advance.</p>

<p>Mrs. S. unites with me in the most heartfelt regret,</p>

P. B. S.<br />

<p>If you happen to have brought a copy of Clarke’s
edition of Queen Mab for me, I should like very well to
see it.&mdash;I really hardly know what this poem is about. I

<p>At length the post brings a welcome letter from you,
and I am pleased to be assured of your health and safe
arrival. I expect with interest and anxiety the intelligence
of your progress in England, and how far the
advantages there compensate the loss of Italy. I hear
from Hunt that he is determined on emigration, and if
I thought the letter would arrive in time, I should beg
you to suggest some advice to him. But you ought
to be incapable of forgiving me the fact of depriving
England of what it must lose when Hunt departs.</p>

<p>Did I tell you that Lord Byron comes to settle at Pisa,
and that he has a plan of writing a periodical work in
conjunction with Hunt? His house, Madame Felichi’s,
is already taken and fitted up for him, and he has been
expected every day these six weeks. La Guiccioli, who
awaits him impatiently, is a very pretty, sentimental,
innocent Italian, who has sacrificed an immense fortune
for the sake of Lord Byron, and who, if I know any thing
of my friend, of her and of human nature, will hereafter<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
have plenty of leisure and opportunity to repent her
rashness. Lord Byron is, however, quite cured of his
gross habits, as far as habits; the perverse ideas on
which they were formed are not yet eradicated.</p>

<p>We have furnished a house at Pisa, and mean to make
it our head-quarters. I shall get all my books out, and
entrench myself like a spider in a web. If you can assist
P. in sending them to Leghorn, you would do me an
especial favour; but do not buy me Calderon, Faust, or
Kant, as H. S.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> promises to send them me from Paris,
where I suppose you had not time to procure them. Any
other books you or Henry think would accord with my
design, Ollier will furnish you with.</p>

<p>I should like very much to hear what is said of my
Adonais, and you would oblige me by cutting out, or
making Ollier cut out, any respectable criticism on it,
and sending it me; you know I do not mind a crown or
two in postage. The Epipsychidion is a mystery; as to
real flesh and blood, you know that I do not deal in those
articles; you might as well go to a gin-shop for a leg of
mutton, as expect anything human or earthly from me.
I desired Ollier not to circulate this piece except to the
συνετοί, and even they, it seems, are inclined to approximate
me to the circle of a servant girl and her sweetheart.
But I intend to write a Symposium of my own to set all
this right.</p>

<p>I am just finishing a dramatic poem, called Hellas,
upon the contest now raging in Greece&mdash;a sort of
imitation of the Persæ of Æschylus, full of lyrical
poetry. I try to be what I might have been, but am not
successful. I find that (I dare say I shall quote wrong,)</p>

<p>The Edinburgh Review lies. Godwin’s answer to
Malthus is victorious and decisive; and that it should
not be generally acknowledged as such, is full evidence
of the influence of successful evil and tyranny. What
Godwin is, compared to Plato and Bacon, we well know;
but compared with these miserable sciolists, he is a vulture
to a worm.</p>

<p>I read the Greek dramatists and Plato for ever. You
are right about Antigone; how sublime a picture of
a woman! and what think you of the choruses, and
especially the lyrical complaints of the godlike victim?
and the menaces of Tiresias, and their rapid fulfilment?
Some of us have, in a prior existence, been in love with
an Antigone, and that makes us find no full content in any
mortal tie. As to books, I advise you to live near the
British Museum, and read there. I have read, since I
saw you, the “Jungfrau von Orleans” of Schiller,&mdash;a
fine play, if the fifth act did not fall off. Some Greeks,
escaped from the defeat in Wallachia, have passed
through Pisa, to re-embark at Leghorn for the Morea;
and the Tuscan Government allowed them, during their
stay and passage, three lire each per day and their
lodging; that is good. Remember me and Mary most
kindly to Mrs. Gisborne and Henry, and believe me,</p>

<p>I have received Hellas, which is prettily printed,
and with fewer mistakes than any poem I ever published.
Am I to thank you for the revision of the
press? or who acted as midwife to this last of my
orphans, introducing it to oblivion, and me to my
accustomed failure? May the cause it celebrates be<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
more fortunate than either! Tell me how you like
<i>Hellas</i>, and give me your opinion freely. It was
written without much care, and in one of those few
moments of enthusiasm which now seldom visit me,
and which make me pay dear for their visits. I know
what to think of <i>Adonais</i>, but what to think of those
who confound it with the many bad poems of the day,
I know not.</p>

<p>I have been reading over and over again Faust,
and always with sensations which no other composition
excites. It deepens the gloom and augments the
rapidity of ideas, and would therefore seem to me an
unfit study for any person who is a prey to the reproaches
of memory, and the delusions of an imagination
not to be restrained. And yet the pleasure of
sympathising with emotions known only to few, although
they derive their sole charm from despair, and the
scorn of the narrow good we can attain in our present
state, seems more than to ease the pain which belongs
to them. Perhaps all discontent with the <i>less</i> (to use
a Platonic sophism) supposes the sense of a just claim
to the <i>greater</i>, and that we admirers of Faust are on
the right road to Paradise. Such a supposition is not
more absurd, and is certainly less demoniacal than
that of Wordsworth, where he says&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse indent0"><i>We find our happiness, or not at all</i>.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As if, after sixty years’ suffering here, we were to be
roasted alive for sixty million more in hell, or charitably
annihilated by a <i>coup-de-grâce</i> of the bungler who
brought us into existence at first!</p>

<p>Have you read Calderon’s <i>Magico Prodigioso</i>? I
find a striking similarity between Faust and this drama,
and if I were to acknowledge Coleridge’s distinction,
should say Goethe was the <i>greatest</i> philosopher,<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_354">[Pg 354]</span> and
Calderon the <i>greatest</i> poet. <i>Cyprian</i> evidently furnished
the <i>germ</i> of Faust, as Faust may furnish the germ of
other poems; although it is as different from it in
structure and plan as the acorn from the oak. I have&mdash;imagine
my presumption&mdash;translated several scenes
from both, as the basis of a paper for our journal. I
am well content with those from Calderon, which in
fact gave me very little trouble; but those from Faust&mdash;I
feel how imperfect a representation, even with all
the licence I assume to figure to myself how Goethe
would have written in English, my words convey. No
one but Coleridge is capable of this work.</p>

<p>We have seen here a translation of some scenes, and
indeed the most remarkable ones, accompanying those
astonishing etchings which have been published in
England from a German master. It is not bad&mdash;and
faithful enough&mdash;but how weak! how incompetent to
represent Faust! I have only attempted the scenes
omitted in this translation, and would send you that
of the <i>Walpurgisnacht</i>, if I thought Ollier would place
the postage to my account. What etchings those are!
I am never satiated with looking at them; and, I fear,
it is the only sort of translation of which Faust is
susceptible. I never perfectly understood the Hartz
Mountain scene, until I saw the etching; and then,
Margaret in the summer-house with Faust! The artist
makes one envy his happiness that he can sketch such
things with calmness, which I only dared look upon
once, and which made my brain swim round only to
touch the leaf on the opposite side of which I knew
that it was figured. Whether it is that the artist has
surpassed Faust, or that the pencil surpasses language
in some subjects, I know not, or that I am more
affected by a visible image, but the etching certainly
excited me far more than the poem it illustrated. Do
you remember the fifty-fourth letter of the first part
of the “Nouvelle Héloïse”? Goethe, in a subsequent<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>
scene, evidently had that letter in his mind, and this
etching is an idealism of it. So much for the world of
shadows!</p>

<p>What think you of Lord Byron’s last volume? In
my opinion it contains finer poetry than has appeared
in England since the publication of “Paradise Regained.”
<i>Cain</i> is apocalyptic&mdash;it is a revelation not
before communicated to man. I write nothing but by fits.
I have done some of “Charles the First,” but although
the poetry succeeded very well, I cannot seize on the
conception of the subject as a whole, and seldom now
touch the canvas. You know I don’t think much about
Reviews, nor of the fame they give, nor that they take
away. It is absurd in any Review to criticise <i>Adonais</i>,
and still more to pretend that the verses are bad.
“Prometheus” was never intended for more than five or
six persons.</p>

<p>And how are you getting on? Do your plans still
want success? Do you regret Italy? or anything that
Italy contains? And in case of an entire failure in
your expectations, do you think of returning here?
You see the first blow has been made at funded-property:&mdash;do
you intend to confide and invite a second? You
would already have saved something per cent., if you
had invested your property in Tuscan land. The next
best thing would be to invest it in English, and reside
upon it. I tremble for the consequences, to you personally,
from a prolonged confidence in the funds.
Justice, policy, the hopes of the nation and renewed
institutions, demand your ruin, and I, for one, cannot
bring myself to desire what is in itself desirable, till you
are free. You see how liberal I am of advice; but you
know the motives that suggest it. What is Henry about,
and how are his prospects? Tell him that some adventurers
are engaged upon a steam-boat at Leghorn, to
make the <i>trajet</i> we projected. I hope he is charitable
enough to pray that they may succeed better than we<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>
did.</p>

<p>Remember me most affectionately to Mrs. Gisborne,
to whom, as well as to yourself, I consider that this
letter is written. How is she, and how are you all in
health? And pray tell me, what are your plans of life,
and how Henry succeeds, and whether he is married or
not? How can I send you such small sums as you may
want for postages, &amp;c., for I do not mean to tax with
my unreasonable letters both your purse and your
patience? We go this summer to Spezzia; but direct
as ever to Pisa,&mdash;Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; will forward our letters.
If you see anything which you think would particularly
interest me, pray make Ollier pay for sending it out by
post. Give my best and affectionate regards to H&mdash;&mdash;,
to whom I do not write at present, imagining that you
will give him a piece of this letter.</p>

</div>

<p>I have, as yet, received neither the * * *, nor his
metaphysical companions&mdash;<i>Time, my Lord, has a wallet
on his back</i>, and I suppose he has bagged them by the way.
As he has had a good deal of “<i>alms</i> for oblivion” out of
me, I think he might as well have favoured me this once;
I have, indeed, just dropped another mite into his treasury,<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_357">[Pg 357]</span>
called <i>Hellas</i>, which I know not how to send to you;
but I dare say, some fury of the Hades of authors will
bring one to Paris. It is a poem written on the Greek
cause last summer&mdash;a sort of lyrical, dramatic, nondescript
piece of business.</p>

<p>You will have heard of a <i>row</i> we have had here, which,
I dare say, will grow to a serious size before it arrives at
Paris. It was, in fact, a trifling piece of business enough,
arising from an insult of a drunken dragoon, offered to
one of our party, and only serious, because one of Lord
Byron’s servants wounded the fellow dangerously with
a pitchfork. He is now, however, recovering, and the
echo of the affair will be heard long after the original
report has ceased.</p>

<p>Lord Byron has read me one or two letters of Moore
to him, in which Moore speaks with great kindness of
me; and, of course, I cannot but feel flattered by the
approbation of a man, my inferiority to whom I am
proud to acknowledge.&mdash;Amongst other things, however,
Moore, after giving Lord Byron much good advice about
public opinion, &amp;c., seems to deprecate <i>my</i> influence on
his mind, on the subject of religion, and to attribute the
tone assumed in “Cain” to my suggestions. Moore
cautions him against my influence on this particular,
with the most friendly zeal; and it is plain that his
motive springs from a desire of benefitting Lord Byron,
without degrading me. I think you know Moore. Pray
assure him that I have not the smallest influence over
Lord Byron, in this particular, and if I had, I certainly
should employ it to eradicate from his great mind the
delusions of Christianity, which, in spite of his reason,
seem perpetually to recur, and to lay in ambush for the
hours of sickness and distress. “Cain” was <i>conceived</i>
many years ago, and begun before I saw him last year
at Ravenna. How happy should I not be to attribute
to myself, however indirectly, any participation in that
immortal work!&mdash;I differ with Moore in thinking Christianity<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>
useful to the world; no man of sense can think
it true; and the alliance of the monstrous superstitions
of the popular worship with the pure doctrines of the
Theism of such a man as Moore, turns to the profit of
the former, and makes the latter the fountain of its own
pollution. I agree with him that the doctrines of the
French, and Material Philosophy, are as false as they
are pernicious; but, still, they are better than Christianity,
inasmuch as anarchy is better than despotism;
for this reason, that the former is for a season, and that
the latter is eternal. My admiration of the character, no
less than of the genius of Moore, makes me rather wish
that he should not have an ill opinion of me.</p>

<p>Where are you? We settle this summer near Spezzia;
Lord Byron at Leghorn. May not I hope to see you
even for a trip in Italy? I hope your wife and little
ones are well. Mine grows a fine boy, and is quite
well.</p>

and prefer the arts and conveniences of that over-civilised
country to the beautiful nature and mighty
remains of Italy? As to me, like Anacreon’s swallow,
I have left my Nile, and have taken up my summer
quarters here, in a lonely house close by the sea-side,
surrounded by the soft and sublime scenery of the gulf
of Spezzia. I do not write; I have lived too long near<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>
Lord Byron, and the sun has extinguished the glow-worm;

<p>The object of my present letter is, however, a request,
and as it concerns that most odious of all subjects,
money, I will put it in the shortest shape. Godwin’s
law-suit, he tells us, is decided against him; and he is
adjudged to pay 900<i>l.</i> He writes, of course, to his
daughter in the greatest distress: but we have no
money except our income, nor any means of procuring
it. My wife has sent him her novel, which is now
finished, the copyright of which will probably bring him
3 or 400<i>l.</i>&mdash;as Ollier offered the former sum for it, but
as he required a considerable delay for the payment,
she rejected his offer. Now, what I wish to know is,
whether you could with convenience lend me the 400<i>l.</i>
which you once dedicated to this service, and allow
Godwin to have it, under the precautions and stipulations
which I formerly annexed to its employment.
You could not obviously allow this money to lie idle
waiting for this event, without interest. I forgot this
part of the business till this instant, and now I reflect
that I ought to have assured you of the regular payment
of interest, which I omitted to mention, considering
it a matter of course.</p>

<p>Pray thank Moore for his obliging message. I wish
I could as easily convey my sense of his genius and
character. I should have written to him on the subject
of my late letter, but that I doubted how far I was justified
in doing so; although, indeed, Lord Byron made
no secret of his communication to me. It seems to me
that things have now arrived at such a crisis as requires
every man plainly to utter his sentiments on the inefficacy
of the existing religion, no less than political systems,
for restraining and guiding mankind. Let us see the
truth, whatever that may be. The destiny of man can
scarcely be so degraded, that he was born only to die;
and if such should be the case, delusions, especially the
gross and preposterous ones of the existing religion, can
scarcely be supposed to exalt it. If every man said
what he thought, it could not subsist a day. But all,
more or less, subdue themselves to the element that
surrounds them, and contribute to the evils they lament
by the hypocrisy that springs from them.</p>

<p>England appears to be in a desperate condition,
Ireland still worse; and no class of those who subsist
on the public labour will be persuaded that <i>their</i> claims
on it must be diminished. But the government must
content itself with less in taxes, the landholder must
submit to receive less rent, and the fundholder a
diminished interest, or they will all get nothing.
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_362">[Pg 362]</span> I
once thought to study these affairs, and write or act in
them. I am glad that my good genius said, <i>refrain</i>.
I see little public virtue, and I foresee that the contest
will be one of blood and gold, two elements which, however
much to my taste in my pockets and my veins, I
have an objection to out of them.</p>

<p>Lord Byron continues at Leghorn, and has just received
from Genoa a most beautiful little yacht, which
he caused to be built there. He has written two new
cantos of “Don Juan,” but I have not seen them. I
have just received a letter from Hunt, who has arrived
at Genoa. As soon as I hear that he has sailed, I shall
weigh anchor in my little schooner, and give him chase
to Leghorn, when I must occupy myself in some arrangements
for him with Lord Byron. Between ourselves,
I greatly fear that this alliance will not succeed; for I,
who could never have been regarded as more than the
link of the two thunderbolts, cannot now consent to be
even that; and how long the alliance may continue, I
will not prophesy. Pray do not hint my doubts on the
subject to any one, or they might do harm to Hunt;
and they <i>may</i> be groundless.</p>

<p>I still inhabit this divine bay, reading Spanish dramas,
and sailing, and listening to the most enchanting music.
We have some friends on a visit to us, and my only
regret is that the summer must ever pass, or that Mary
has not the same predilection for this place that I have,
which would induce me never to shift my quarters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Mary</span>,</p>
</div>

<p>I have received both your letters, and shall attend
to the instructions they convey. I did not think of
buying the Bolivar; Lord Byron wishes to sell her, but I
imagine would prefer ready money. I have as yet made
no inquiries about houses near Pugnano&mdash;I have no
moment of time to spare from Hunt’s affairs; I am
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_364">[Pg 364]</span>
detained unwillingly here, and you will probably see
Williams in the boat before me,&mdash;but that will be
decided to-morrow.</p>

<p>Things are in the worst possible situation with
respect to poor Hunt. I find Marianne in a desperate
state of health, and on our arrival at Pisa sent for
Vaccà. He decides that her case is hopeless, and that
although it will be lingering, must inevitably end fatally.
This decision he thought proper to communicate to
Hunt, indicating at the same time, with great judgment
and precision, the treatment necessary to be observed
for availing himself of the chance of his being deceived.
This intelligence has extinguished the last spark of poor
Hunt’s spirits, low enough before. The children are
well and much improved.</p>

<p>Lord Byron is at this moment on the point of leaving
Tuscany. The Gambas have been exiled, and he
declares his intention of following their fortunes. His
first idea was to sail to America, which was changed to
Switzerland, then to Genoa, and last to Lucca. Everybody
is in despair, and everything in confusion.
Trelawny was on the point of sailing to Genoa for the
purpose of transporting the Bolivar overland to the lake
of Geneva, and had already whispered in my ear his
desire that I should not influence Lord Byron against
this terrestrial navigation. He next received <i>orders</i> to
weigh anchor and set sail for Lerici. He is now without
instructions, moody and disappointed. But it is the
worst for poor Hunt, unless the present storm should
blow over. He places his whole dependence upon the
scheme of a journal, for which every arrangement has
been made. Lord Byron must of course furnish the
requisite funds at present, as I cannot; but he seems
inclined to depart without the necessary explanations
and arrangements due to such a situation as Hunt’s.
These, in spite of delicacy, I must procure; he offers
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>
him the copyright of the Vision of Judgment for the first
number. This offer, if sincere, is <i>more</i> than enough to
set up the journal, and, if sincere, will set everything
right.</p>

<p>How are you, my best Mary? Write especially how
is your health, and how your spirits are, and whether
you are not more reconciled to staying at Lerici, at least
during the summer.</p>

<p>You have no idea how I am hurried and occupied;
I have not a moment’s leisure, but will write by next
post.</p>

Ever, dearest Mary,<br />
Yours affectionately,<br />

</div>

<p>As the station to which you have been called by
your country is important, so much the more awful is
your responsibility, so much the more does it become
you to watch lest you inadvertently punish the virtuous
and reward the vicious.</p>

<p>You preside over a court which is instituted for the
suppression of crime, and to whose authority the people
submit on no other conditions than that its decrees
should be conformable to justice.</p>

<p>If it should be demonstrated that a judge had condemned
an innocent man, the bare existence of laws in
conformity to which the accused is punished, would but
little extenuate his offence. The inquisitor when he
burns an obstinate heretic may set up a similar plea,
yet few are sufficiently blinded by intolerance to acknowledge
its validity. It will less avail such a judge
to assert the policy of punishing one who has committed
no crime. Policy and morality ought to be deemed
synonymous in a court of justice, and he whose conduct
has been regulated by the latter principle, is not justly
amenable to any penal law for a supposed violation of
the former. It is true, my Lord, laws exist which
suffice to screen you from the animadversions of any
constituted power, in consequence of the unmerited sentence
which you have passed upon Mr. Eaton; but there
are no laws which screen you from the reproof of a
nation’s disgust, none which ward off the just judgment
of posterity, if that posterity will deign to recollect you.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_374">[Pg 374]</span></p>
<p>By what right do you punish Mr. Eaton? What but
antiquated precedents, gathered from times of priestly
and tyrannical domination, can be adduced in palliation
of an outrage so insulting to humanity and justice?
Whom has he injured? What crime has he committed?
Wherefore may he not walk abroad like other men and
follow his accustomed pursuits? What end is proposed
in confining this man, charged with the commission of
no dishonourable action? Wherefore did his aggressor
avail himself of popular prejudice, and return no answer
but one of common place contempt to a defence of plain
and simple sincerity? Lastly, when the prejudices of
the jury, as Christians, were strongly and unfairly inflamed<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
against this injured man as a Deist, wherefore
did not you, my Lord, check such unconstitutional
pleading, and desire the jury to pronounce the accused
innocent or criminal<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> without reference to the particular
faith which he professed?</p>

<p>In the name of justice, what answer is there to these
questions? The answer which Heathen Athens made
to Socrates, is the same with which Christian England
must attempt to silence the advocates of this injured
man&mdash;“He has questioned established opinions.”&mdash;Alas!
the crime of enquiry is one which religion never
has forgiven. Implicit faith and fearless enquiry have
in all ages been irreconcileable enemies. Unrestrained
philosophy has in every age opposed itself to the
reveries of credulity and fanaticism.&mdash;The truths of
astronomy demonstrated by Newton have superseded
astrology; since the modern discoveries in chemistry
the philosopher’s stone has no longer been deemed
attainable. Miracles of every kind have become rare,
in proportion to the hidden principles which those who
study nature have developed. That which is false will
ultimately be controverted by its own falsehood. That<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_375">[Pg 375]</span>
which is true needs but publicity to be acknowledged.
It is ever a proof that the falsehood of a proposition is
felt by those who use power and coercion, not reasoning
and persuasion, to procure its admission.&mdash;Falsehood
skulks in holes and corners, “it lets I dare not wait
upon I would, like the poor cat in the adage,”<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> except
when it has power, and then, as it was a coward, it
is a tyrant; but the eagle-eye of truth darts through
the undazzling sunbeam of the immutable and just,
gathering thence wherewith to vivify and illuminate
a universe!</p>

<p>Wherefore, I repeat, is Mr. Eaton punished?&mdash;Because
he is a Deist?&mdash;And what are you, my Lord?&mdash;A
Christian. Ha then! the mask is fallen off; you
persecute him because his faith differs from yours.
You copy the persecutors of Christianity in your
actions, and are an additional proof that your religion
is as bloody, barbarous, and intolerant as theirs.&mdash;If
some deistical Bigot in power (supposing such a character
for the sake of illustration) should in dark and
barbarous ages have enacted a statute making the
profession of christianity criminal, if you my Lord were
a christian bookseller, and Mr. Eaton a judge, those
arguments which you consider adequate to justify yourself
for the sentence which you have passed must
likewise suffice, in this suppositionary case to justify
Mr. Eaton, in sentencing you to Newgate and the
pillory for being a christian. Whence is any right
derived but that which power confers for persecution?
Do you think to convert Mr. Eaton to your religion by
embittering his existence? You might force him by
torture to profess your tenets, but he could not believe
them, except you should make them credible, which
perhaps exceeds your power. Do you think to please
the God you worship by this exhibition of your zeal?
If so, the Demon to whom some nations offer human<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_376">[Pg 376]</span>
hecatombs is less barbarous than the Deity of civilized
society.</p>

<p>You consider man as an accountable being&mdash;but he
can only be accountable for those actions which are
influenced by his will.</p>

<p>Belief and disbelief are utterly distinct from and
unconnected with volition. They are the apprehension
of the agreement or disagreement of the ideas which
compose any proposition. Belief is an involuntary
operation of the mind, and, like other passions, its
intensity is precisely proportionate to the degrees of
excitement. Volition is essential to merit or demerit.
How then can merit or demerit be attached to what is
distinct from that faculty of the mind whose presence
is essential to their being? I am aware that religion
is founded on the voluntariness of belief, as it makes it
a subject of reward and punishment; but before we
extinguish the steady ray of reason and common sense,
it is fit that we should discover, which we cannot do
without their assistance, whether or no there be any
other which may suffice to guide us through the labyrinth
of life.</p>

<p>If the law ‘de heretico comburendo’ has not been
formally repealed, I conceive that, from the promise
held out by your Lordship’s zeal, we need not despair
of beholding the flames of persecution rekindled in
Smithfield. Even now the lash that drove Descartes
and Voltaire from their native country, the chains
which bound Galileo, the flames which burned Vanini,
again resound:&mdash;And where? in a nation that presumptuously
calls itself the sanctuary of freedom.
Under a government which, whilst it infringes the
very right of thought and speech, boasts of permitting
the liberty of the press; in a civilized and enlightened
country, a man is pilloried and imprisoned because he
is a Deist, and no one raises his voice in the indignation
of outraged humanity. Does the Christian God,<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_377">[Pg 377]</span>
whom his followers eulogize as the Deity of humility
and peace; he, the regenerator of the world, the meek
reformer, authorize one man to rise against another, and
because lictors are at his beck, to chain and torture
him as an Infidel?</p>

<p>When the Apostles went abroad to convert the
nations, were they enjoined to stab and poison all who
disbelieved the divinity of Christ’s mission; assuredly,
they would have been no more justifiable in this case
than he is at present who puts into execution the law
which inflicts pillory and imprisonment on the Deist.</p>

<p>Has not Mr. Eaton an equal right to call your Lordship
an Infidel, as you have to imprison him for promulgating
a different doctrine from that which you
profess?&mdash;What do I say!&mdash;Has he not even a stronger
plea?&mdash;The word <i>Infidel</i> can only mean any thing
when applied to a person who professes that which he
disbelieves. The test of truth is an undivided reliance
on its inclusive powers;&mdash;the test of conscious falsehood
is the variety of the forms under which it presents
itself, and its tendency towards employing whatever
coercive means may be within its command, in order
to procure the admission of what is unsusceptible of
support from reason or persuasion. A dispassionate
observer would feel himself more powerfully interested
in favor of a man, who depending on the truth of his
opinions, simply stated his reasons for entertaining
them, than in that of his aggressor, who daringly
avowing his unwillingness to answer them by argument,
proceeded to repress the activity and break the spirit
of their promulgator, by that torture and imprisonment
whose infliction he could command.</p>

<p>I hesitate not to affirm that the opinions which Mr.
Eaton sustained, when undergoing that mockery of a
trial at which your Lordship presided, appear to me
more true and good than those of his accuser;&mdash;but
were they false as the visions of a Calvinist, it <span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_378">[Pg 378]</span>still would
be the duty of those who love liberty and virtue, to raise
their voice indignantly against a reviving system of persecution,
against the coercively repressing any opinion,
which, if false, needs but the opposition of truth; which,
if true, in spite of force, must ultimately prevail.</p>

<p>Mr. Eaton asserted that the scriptures were, from
beginning to end, a fable and imposture,<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> that the
Apostles were liars and deceivers. He denied the
miracles, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ.&mdash;He
did so, and the Attorney General denied the propositions
which he asserted, and asserted those which
he denied. What singular conclusion is deducible from
this fact? None, but that the Attorney General and
Mr. Eaton sustained two opposite opinions. The
Attorney General puts some obsolete and tyrannical
laws in force against Mr. Eaton, because he publishes
a book tending to prove that certain supernatural events,
which are supposed to have taken place eighteen centuries
ago, in a remote corner of the world, did not
actually take place. But how are the truth or falsehood
of the facts in dispute relevant to the merit or demerit
attachable to the advocates of the two opinions? No
man is accountable for his belief, because no man is
capable of directing it. Mr. Eaton is therefore totally
blameless. What are we to think of the justice of a
sentence, which punishes an individual against whom it
is not even attempted to attach the slightest stain of
criminality?</p>

<p>It is asserted that Mr. Eaton’s opinions are calculated
to subvert morality&mdash;How? What moral truth is
spoken of with irreverence or ridicule in the book which
he published? Morality, or the duty of a man and a
citizen, is founded on the relations which arise from the
association of human beings, and which vary with the
circumstances produced by the different states of this
association.&mdash;This duty in similar situations must be<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_379">[Pg 379]</span>
precisely the same in all ages and nations.&mdash;The opinion
contrary to this has arisen from a supposition that the
will of God is the source or criterion of morality: it is
plain that the utmost exertion of Omnipotence could
not cause that to be virtuous which actually is vicious.
An all-powerful Demon might, indubitably, annex
punishments to virtue and rewards to vice, but could
not by these means effect the slightest change in their
abstract and immutable natures.&mdash;Omnipotence could
vary, by a providential interposition, the relations of
human society;&mdash;in this latter case, what before was
virtuous would become vicious, according to the necessary
and natural result of the alteration; but the abstract
natures of the opposite principles would have sustained
not the slightest change; for instance, the punishment
with which society restrains the robber, the assassin,
and the ravisher is just, laudable, and requisite. We
admire and respect the institutions which curb those
who would defeat the ends for which society was established;&mdash;but,
should a precisely similar coercion be
exercised against one who merely expressed his disbelief
of a system admitted by those entrusted with the executive
power, using at the same time no methods of promulgation
but those afforded by reason, certainly this
coercion would be eminently inhuman and immoral;
and the supposition that any revelation from an unknown
power avails to palliate a persecution so senseless, unprovoked,
and indefensible, is at once to destroy the
barrier which reason places between vice and virtue, and
leave to unprincipled fanaticism a plea whereby it may
excuse every act of frenzy, which its own wild passions,
not the inspirations of the Deity, have engendered.</p>

<p>Moral qualities are such as only a human being can
possess. To attribute them to the Spirit of the Universe,
or to suppose that it is capable of altering them, is to
degrade God into man, and to annex to this incomprehensible
being qualities incompatible with any <i>possible</i><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_380">[Pg 380]</span>
definition of his nature. It may here be objected&mdash;Ought
not the Creator to possess the perfections of the
creature? No. To attribute to God the moral qualities
of man, is to suppose him susceptible of passions which,
arising out of corporeal organisation, it is plain that a
pure spirit cannot possess. A bear is not perfect except
he is rough, a tyger is not perfect if he be not voracious,
an elephant is not perfect if otherwise than docile. How
<i>deep</i> an argument must that not be which proves that
the Deity is as rough as a bear, as voracious as a tyger,
and as docile as an elephant! But even suppose with
the vulgar, that God is a venerable old man, seated on
a throne of clouds, his breast the theatre of various
passions, analogous to those of humanity, his will
changeable and uncertain as that of an earthly king,&mdash;still
goodness and justice are qualities seldom nominally
denied him, and it will be admitted that he disapproves
of any action incompatible with these qualities. Persecution
for opinion is unjust. With what consistency, then,
can the worshippers of a Deity whose benevolence they
boast, embitter the existence of their fellow being,
because his ideas of that Deity are different from those
which they entertain.&mdash;Alas! there is no consistency in
those persecutors who worship a benevolent Deity; those
who worship a Demon would alone act consonantly to
these principles, by imprisoning and torturing in his
name.</p>

<p>Persecution is the only name applicable to punishment
inflicted on an individual in consequence of his opinions.&mdash;What
end is persecution designed to answer? Can
it convince him whom it injures? Can it prove to the
people the falsehood of his opinions? It may make
<i>him</i> a hypocrite, and them cowards, but bad means can
promote no good end. The unprejudiced mind looks
with suspicion on a doctrine that needs the sustaining
hand of power.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_381">[Pg 381]</span></p>
<p>Socrates was poisoned because he dared to combat
the degrading superstitions in which his countrymen
were educated. Not long after his death, Athens recognized
the injustice of his sentence; his accuser Melitus
was condemned, and Socrates became a demigod.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ was crucified because he attempted to
supersede the ritual of Moses with regulations more
moral and humane&mdash;his very judge made public
acknowledgment of his innocence, but a bigotted and
ignorant mob demanded the deed of horror.&mdash;Barabbas
the murderer and traitor was released. The meek
reformer Jesus was immolated to the sanguinary Deity
of the Jews. Time rolled on, time changed the situations,
and with them, the opinions of men.</p>

<p>The vulgar, ever in extremes, became persuaded that
the crucifixion of Jesus was a supernatural event, and
testimonies of miracles, so frequent in unenlightened
ages, were not wanting to prove that he was something
divine. This belief, rolling through the lapse of ages,
acquired force and extent, until the divinity of Jesus
became a dogma, which to dispute was death, which to
doubt was infamy.</p>

<p><i>Christianity</i> is now the established religion; he who
attempts to disprove it, must behold murderers and
traitors take precedence of him in public opinion, though,
if his genius be equal to his courage, and assisted by
a peculiar coalition of circumstances, future ages may
exalt him to a divinity, and persecute others in his
name, as he was persecuted in the name of his predecessor,
in the homage of the world.</p>

<p>The same means that have supported every other
popular belief, have supported Christianity. War,
imprisonment, murder, and falsehood; deeds of unexampled
and incomparable atrocity have made it what
it is. We derive from our ancestors a belief thus
fostered and supported.&mdash;We quarrel, persecute, and
hate for its maintenance.&mdash;Does not analogy favour the
opinion that, as like other systems it has arisen and<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_382">[Pg 382]</span>
augmented, so like them it will decay and perish; that,
as violence and falsehood, not reasoning and persuasion,
have procured its admission among mankind; so, when
enthusiasm has subsided, and time, that infallible controverter
of false opinions, has involved its pretended
evidences in the darkness of antiquity, it will become
obsolete, and that men will then laugh as heartily at
grace, faith, redemption, and original sin, as they now
do at the metamorphoses of Jupiter, the miracles of
Romish saints, the efficacy of witchcraft, and the
appearance of departed spirits.</p>

<p>Had the christian religion commenced and continued
by the mere force of reasoning and persuasion, by its
self-evident excellence and fitness, the preceding analogy
would be inadmissible. We should never speculate
upon the future obsoleteness of a system perfectly conformable
to nature and reason. It would endure so long
as they endured, it would be a truth as indisputable as
the light of the sun, the criminality of murder, and other
facts, physical and moral, which, depending on our
organization, and relative situations, must remain acknowledged
so long as man is man.&mdash;It is an incontrovertible
fact, the consideration of which ought to
repress the hasty conclusions of credulity, or moderate
its obstinacy in maintaining them, that, had the Jews
not been a barbarous and fanatical race of men, had
even the resolution of Pontius Pilate been equal to his
candour, the christian religion never could have
prevailed, it could not even have existed. Man! the
very existence of whose most cherished opinions depends
from a thread so feeble, arises out of a source so
equivocal, learn at least humility; own at least that it
is possible for thyself also to have been seduced by
education and circumstance into the admission of tenets
destitute of rational proof, and the truth of which has
not yet been satisfactorily demonstrated. Acknowledge
at least that the falsehood of thy brother’s opinions<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_383">[Pg 383]</span> is no
sufficient reason for his meriting thy hatred.&mdash;What!
because a fellow being disputes the reasonableness of
thy faith, wilt thou punish him with torture and imprisonment?
If persecution for religious opinions were
admitted by the moralist, how wide a door would not
be opened by which convulsionists of every kind might
make inroads on the peace of society! How many
deeds of barbarism and blood would not receive a
sanction!&mdash;But I will demand, if that man is not
rather entitled to the respect than the discountenance of
society, who, by disputing a received doctrine, either
proves its falsehood and inutility, thereby aiming at the
abolition of what is false and useless, or giving to its
adherents an opportunity of establishing its excellence
and truth.&mdash;Surely this can be no crime. Surely the
individual who devotes his time to fearless and unrestricted
inquiry into the grand questions arising out of
our moral nature, ought rather to receive the patronage,
than encounter the vengeance, of an enlightened legislature.
I would have you to know, my Lord, that
fetters of iron cannot bind or subdue the soul of virtue.
From the damps and solitude of its dungeon it ascends
free and undaunted, whither thine, from the pompous
seat of judgment, dare not soar. I do not warn you to
beware lest your profession as a Christian, should make
you forget that you are a man;&mdash;but I warn you against
festinating that period, which, under the present coercive
system, is too rapidly maturing, when the seats of
justice shall be the seats of venality and slavishness, and
the cells of Newgate become the abode of all that is
honorable and true.</p>

<p>I mean not to compare Mr. Eaton with Socrates or
Jesus; he is a man of blameless and respectable character,
he is a citizen unimpeached with crime; if, therefore,
his rights as a citizen and a man have been infringed,
they have been infringed by illegal and immoral violence.
But I will assert that, should a second Jesus arise among<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_384">[Pg 384]</span>
men; should such a one as Socrates again enlighten the
earth, lengthened imprisonment and infamous punishment
(according to the regimen of persecution revived
by your Lordship) would effect, what hemlock and the
cross have heretofore effected, and the stain on the
national character, like that on Athens and Judea,
would remain indelible, but by the destruction of the
history in which it is recorded. When the Christian
Religion shall have faded from the earth, when its
memory like that of Polytheism now shall remain, but
remain only as the subject of ridicule and wonder,
indignant posterity would attach immortal infamy to
such an outrage; like the murder of Socrates, it would
secure the execration of every age.</p>

<p>The horrible and wide-wasting enormities which gleam
like comets through the darkness of gothic and superstitious
ages, are regarded by the moralist as no more
than the necessary effects of known causes; but, when
an enlightened age and nation signalizes itself by a
deed, becoming none but barbarians and fanatics, Philosophy
itself is even induced to doubt whether human
nature will ever emerge from the pettishness and imbecility
of its childhood. The system of persecution at
whose new birth, you, my Lord, are one of the presiding
midwives, is not more impotent and wicked than inconsistent.
The press is loaded with what are called
(ironically, I should conceive) <i>proofs</i> of the Christian
Religion: these books are replete with invective and
calumny against Infidels, they presuppose that he who
rejects Christianity must be utterly divested of reason
and feeling. They advance the most unsupported assertions,
and take as first principles the most revolting
dogmas. The inferences drawn from these assumed
premises are imposingly logical and correct; but if a
foundation is weak, no architect is needed to foretell the
instability of the superstructure.&mdash;If the truth of Christianity
is not disputable, for what purpose are these<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_385">[Pg 385]</span>
books written? If they are sufficient to prove it, what
further need of controversy? <i>If God has spoken, why
is not the universe convinced?</i> If the Christian Religion
needs deeper learning, more painful investigation, to
establish its genuineness, wherefore attempt to accomplish
that by force, which the human mind can alone
effect with satisfaction to itself? If, lastly, its truth
<i>cannot</i> be demonstrated, wherefore impotently attempt
to snatch from God the government of his creation, and
impiously assert that the Spirit of Benevolence has left
that knowledge most essential to the well being of man,
the only one which, since its promulgation, has been the
subject of unceasing cavil, the cause of irreconcileable
hatred?&mdash;Either the Christian Religion is true, or it is
not. If true, it comes from God, and its authenticity
can admit of doubt and dispute no further than its
Omnipotent Author is willing to allow;&mdash;if true, it
admits of rational proof, and is capable of being placed
equally beyond controversy, as the principles which have
been established concerning matter and mind, by Locke
and Newton; and in proportion to the usefulness of the
fact in dispute, so must it be supposed that a benevolent
being is anxious to procure the diffusion of its knowledge
on the earth.&mdash;If false, surely no enlightened legislature
would punish the reasoner, who opposes a system so
much the more fatal and pernicious as it is extensively
admitted; so much the more productive of absurd and
ruinous consequences, as it is entwined by education,
with the prejudices and affections of the human heart,
in the shape of a popular belief.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that some half-witted philosopher
should assert that the earth was the centre of the universe,
or that ideas could enter the human mind independently
of sensation or reflection. This man would assert what
is demonstrably incorrect;&mdash;he would promulgate a
false opinion. Yet, would he therefore deserve pillory
and imprisonment? By no means; probably few would<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_386">[Pg 386]</span>
discharge more correctly the duties of a citizen and a
man. I admit that the case above stated is not precisely
in point. The thinking part of the community has not
received as indisputable the truth of Christianity, as they
have that of the Newtonian system. A very large portion
of society, and that powerfully and extensively connected,
derives its sole emolument from the belief of
Christianity, as a popular faith.</p>

<p>To torture and imprison the asserter of a dogma,
however ridiculous and false, is highly barbarous and
impolitic:&mdash;How, then, does not the cruelty of persecution
become aggravated when it is directed against the
opposer of an opinion <i>yet under dispute</i>, and which men
of unrivalled acquirements, penetrating genius, and stainless
virtue, have spent, and at last sacrificed, their lives
in combating.</p>

<p>The time is rapidly approaching, I hope, that you, my
Lord, may live to behold its arrival, when the Mahometan,
the Jew, the Christian, the Deist, and the Atheist, will
live together in one community, equally sharing the
benefits which arise from its association, and united in
the bonds of charity and brotherly love.&mdash;My Lord, you
have condemned an innocent man&mdash;no crime was imputed
to him&mdash;and you sentenced him to torture and
imprisonment. I have not addressed this letter to you
with the hopes of convincing you that you have acted
wrong. The most unprincipled and barbarous of men
are not unprepared with sophisms, to prove that they
would have acted in no other manner, and to show that
vice is virtue. But I raise my solitary voice, to express
my disapprobation, so far as it goes, of the cruel and
unjust sentence you passed upon Mr. Eaton; to assert,
so far as I am capable of influencing, those rights of
humanity, which you have wantonly and unlawfully
infringed.</p>

<p class="dropcap-first-letter">Is the suffrage of mankind the legitimate criterion
of intellectual energy? Are complaints of the
aspirants to literary fame to be considered as
the honourable disappointment of neglected genius, or
the sickly impatience of a dreamer miserably self deceived?
the most illustrious ornaments of the annals
of the human race have been stigmatised by the contempt
and abhorrence of entire communities of man;
but this injustice arose out of some temporary superstition,
some partial interest, some national doctrine: a
glorious redemption awaited their remembrance. There
is indeed, nothing so remarkable in the contempt of the
ignorant for the enlightened: the vulgar pride of folly
delights to triumph upon mind. This is an intelligible
process: the infamy or ingloriousness that can be thus
explained detracts nothing from the beauty of virtue or<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_388">[Pg 388]</span>
the sublimity of genius. But what does utter obscurity
express? If the public do not advert even in censure to a
performance, has that performance already received its
condemnation?</p>

<p>The result of this controversy is important to the
ingenuous critic. His labours are indeed miserably
worthless if their objects may invariably be attained
before their application. He should know the limits of
his prerogative. He should not be ignorant, whether it
is his duty to promulgate the decisions of others, or to
cultivate his taste and judgment, that he may be enabled
to render a reason for his own.</p>

<p>Circumstances the least connected with intellectual
nature have contributed, for a certain period, to retain
in obscurity the most memorable specimens of human
genius. The author refrains perhaps from introducing
his production to the world with all the pomp of
empirical bibliopolism. A sudden tide in the affairs of
men may make the neglect or contradiction of some
insignificant doctrine a badge of obscurity and discredit:
those even who are exempt from the action of these
absurd predilections are necessarily in an indirect
manner affected by their influence. It is perhaps the
product of an imagination daring and undisciplined:
the majority of readers ignorant and disdaining toleration
refuse to pardon a neglect of common rules; their
canons of criticism are carelessly infringed, it is less
religious than a charity sermon, less methodical and
cold than a French tragedy, where all the unities are
preserved: no excellencies, where prudish cant and dull
regularity are absent, can preserve it from the contempt
and abhorrence of the multitude. It is evidently not
difficult to imagine an instance in which the most
elevated genius shall be recompensed with neglect.
Mediocrity alone seems unvaryingly to escape rebuke
and obloquy, it accommodates its attempts to the spirit
of the age which has produced it, and adopts with mimic<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_389">[Pg 389]</span>
effrontery the cant of the day and hour for which alone
it lives.</p>

<p>We think that “the Memoirs of Prince Alexy Haimatoff”
deserves to be regarded as an example of the fact
by the frequency of which criticism is vindicated from
the imputation of futility and impertinence. We do not
hesitate to consider this fiction as the product of a bold and
original mind. We hardly remember ever to have seen
surpassed the subtle delicacy of imagination, by which
the manifest distinctions of character and form are seized
and pictured in colours that almost make nature more
beautiful than herself. The vulgar observe no resemblances
or discrepancies, but such as are gross and
glaring. The science of mind to which history, poetry,
biography serve as the materials, consists in the discernment
of shades and distinctions where the unenlightened
discover nothing but a shapeless and unmeaning mass.
The faculty for this discernment distinguishes genius
from dulness. There are passages in the production
before us which afford instances of just and rapid
intuition belonging only to intelligences that possess
this faculty in no ordinary degree. As a composition
the book is far from faultless. Its abruptness and
angularities do not appear to have received the slightest
polish or correction. The author has written with
fervour, but has disdained to revise at leisure. These
errors are the errors of youth and genius and the fervid
impatience of sensibilities impetuously disburthening
their fulness. The author is proudly negligent of connecting
the incidents of his tale. It appears more like
the recorded day dream of a poet, not unvisited by the
sublimest and most lovely visions, than the tissue of a
romance skilfully interwoven for the purpose of maintaining
the interest of the reader, and conducting his
sympathies by dramatic gradations to the denoûment.
It is, what it professes to be, a memoir, not a novel.
Yet its claims to the former appellation are established,<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_390">[Pg 390]</span>
only by the impatience and inexperience of the author,
who, possessing in an eminent degree, the higher
qualifications of a novelist, we had almost said a poet,
has neglected the number by which that success would
probably have been secured, which, in this instance,
merits of a far nobler stamp have unfortunately failed to
acquire. Prince Alexy is by no means an unnatural,
although no common character. We think we can
discern his counterpart in Alfieri’s delineation of himself.
The same propensities, the same ardent devotion to his
purposes, the same chivalric and unproductive attachment
to unbounded liberty, characterises both. We are
inclined to doubt whether the author has not attributed
to his hero the doctrines of universal philanthropy in
a spirit of profound and almost unsearchable irony: at
least he appears biassed by no peculiar principles, and
it were perhaps an insoluble inquiry whether any, and if
any, what moral truth he designed to illustrate by his
tale. Bruhle, the tutor of Alexy, is a character delineated
with consummate skill; the power of intelligence
and virtue over external deficiencies is forcibly exemplified.
The calmness, patience and magnanimity of this
singular man, are truly rare and admirable: his disinterestedness,
his equanimity, his irresistible gentleness,
form a finished and delightful portrait. But we cannot
regard his commendation to his pupil to indulge in
promiscuous concubinage without horror and detestation.
The author appears to deem the loveless intercourse of
brutal appetite a venial offence against delicacy and
virtue! he asserts that a transient connexion with a
cultivated female may contribute to form the heart without
essentially vitiating the sensibilities. It is our duty
to protest against so pernicious and disgusting an
opinion. No man can rise pure from the poisonous
embraces of a prostitute, or sinless from the desolated
hopes of a confiding heart. Whatever may be the
claims of chastity, whatever the advantages of <span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_391">[Pg 391]</span>simple
and pure affections, these ties, these benefits, are of
equal obligation to either sex. Domestic relations
depend for their integrity upon a complete reciprocity of
duties. But the author himself has in the adventure of
the Sultana, Debesh-Sheptuti, afforded a most impressive
and tremendous allegory of the cold-blooded and malignant
selfishness of sensuality.</p>

<p>We are incapacitated by the unconnected and vague
narrative from forming an analysis of the incidents:
they would consist indeed, simply of a catalogue of
events, and which, divested of the aërial tinge of
genius, might appear trivial and common. We shall
content ourselves, therefore, with selecting some passages
calculated to exemplify the peculiar powers of
the author. The following description of the simple
and interesting Rosalie is in the highest style of delineation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Her hair was unusually black, she truly had raven locks, the
same glossiness, the same varying shade, the same mixture of
purple and sable for which the plumage of the raven is remarkable,
were found in the long elastic tresses depending from her
head and covering her shoulders. Her complexion was dark
and clear: the colours which composed the brown that dyed
her smooth skin, were so well mixed, that not one blot, not one
varied tinge, injured its brightness, and when the blush of
animation or of modesty flushed her cheek, the tint was so rare,
that could a painter have dipped his pencil in it, that single
shade would have rendered him immortal. The bone above
her eye was sharp, and beautifully curved; much as I have
admired the wonderful properties of curves, I am convinced
that their most stupendous properties collected would fall far
short of that magic line. The eyebrow was pencilled with
extreme nicety; in the centre it consisted of the deepest shade
of black, at the edges it was hardly perceptible, and no man
could have been hardy enough to have attempted to define the
precise spot at which it ceased: in short the velvet drapery of
the eyebrow was only to be rivalled by the purple of the long
black eyelashes that terminated the ample curtain. Rosalie’s
eyes were large and full; they appeared at a distance uniformly
dark, but upon close inspection the innumerable strokes of
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_392">[Pg 392]</span>various hues of infinite fineness and endless variety, drawn
in concentric circles behind the pellucid crystal, filled the mind
with wonder and admiration, and could only be the work of
infinite power directed by infinite wisdom.”</p>
</div>

<p>Alexy’s union with Aür-Ahebeh the Circassian slave
is marked by circumstances of deep pathos, and the
sweetest tenderness of sentiment. The description of
his misery and madness at her death deserves to be
remarked as affording evidence of an imagination vast,
profound and full of energy.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Alexy, who gained the friendship, perhaps the love of the
native Rosalie: the handsome Haimatoff, the philosophic
Haimatoff, the haughty Haimatoff, Haimatoff the gay, the
witty, the accomplished, the bold hunter, the friend of liberty,
the chivalric lover of all that is feminine, the hero, the enthusiast:
see him now, that is he, mark him! he appears in the
shades of evening, he stalks as a spectre, he has just risen from
the damps of the charnel-house; see, the dews still hang on his
forehead. He will vanish at cock-crowing, he never heard the
song of the lark, nor the busy hum of men; the sun’s rays
never warmed him, the pale moonbeam alone shows his unearthly
figure, which is fanned by the wing of the owl, which
scarce obstructs the slow flight of the droning beetle, or of the
drowsy bat. Mark him! he stops, his lean arms are crossed on
his bosom; he is bowed to the earth, his sunken eye gazes from
its deep cavity on vacuity, as the toad skulking in the corner of
a sepulchre, peeps with malignity through the circumambient
gloom. His cheek is hollow; the glowing tints of his complexion,
which once resembled the autumnal sunbeam on the
autumnal beech, are gone, the cadaverous yellow, the livid hue,
have usurped their place, the sable honours of his head have
perished, they once waved in the wind like the jetty pinions of
the raven, the skull is only covered by the shrivelled skin,
which the rook views wistfully, and calls to her young ones.
His gaunt bones start from his wrinkled garments, his voice is
deep, hollow, sepulchral; it is the voice which wakes the dead,
he has long held converse with the departed. He attempts to
walk he knows not whither, his legs totter under him, he falls,
the boys hoot him, the dogs bark at him, he hears them not, he
sees them not.&mdash;Rest there, Alexy, it beseemeth thee, thy bed
is the grave, thy bride is the worm, yet once thou stoodest
erect, thy cheek was flushed with joyful ardour, thy eye blazing
<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_393">[Pg 393]</span>told what thy head conceived, what thy heart felt, thy limbs
were vigour and activity, thy bosom expanded with pride,
ambition, and desire, every nerve thrilled to feel, every muscle
swelled to execute.</p>

<p>“Haimatoff, the blight has tainted thee, thou ample roomy
web of life, whereon were traced the gaudy characters, the gay
embroidery of pleasure, how has the moth battened on thee;
Haimatoff, how has the devouring flame scorched the plains,
once yellow with the harvest! the simoon, the parching breath
of the desert, has swept over the laughing plains, the carpet of
verdure rolled away at its approach, and has bared amid desolation.
Thou stricken deer, thy leather coat, thy dappled hide
hangs loose upon thee, it was a deadly arrow, how has it wasted
thee, thou scathed oak, how has the red lightning drank thy
sap: Haimatoff, Haimatoff, eat thy soul with vexation. Let
the immeasurable ocean roll between thee and pride: you must
not dwell together,” p. 129</p>
</div>

<p>The episode of Viola is affecting, natural, and beautiful.
We do not ever remember to have seen the unforgiving
fastidiousness of family honour more awfully
illustrated. After the death of her lover, Viola still
expects that he will esteem, still cherishes the delusion
that he is not lost to her for ever.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“She used frequently to go to the window to look for him,
or walk in the Park to meet him, but without the least impatience,
at his delay. She learnt a new tune, or a new song to
amuse him, she stood behind the door to startle him as he
entered, or disguised herself to surprise him.”</p>
</div>

<p>The character of Mary, deserves, we think, to be
considered as the only complete failure in the book.
Every other female whom the author has attempted
to describe is designated by an individuality peculiarly
marked and true. They constitute finished portraits
of whatever is eminently simple, graceful, gentle, or
disgustingly atrocious and vile. Mary alone is the
miserable parasite of fashion, the tame slave of drivelling
and drunken folly, the cold-hearted coquette, the lying
and meretricious prude. The means employed to gain<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_394">[Pg 394]</span>
this worthless prize corresponds exactly with its worthlessness.
Sir Fulke Hildebrand is a strenuous Tory,
Alexy, on his arrival in England professes himself
inclined to the principles of the Whig party, finding
that the Baronet had sworn that his daughter should
never marry a Whig, he sacrifices his principles and
with inconceivable effrontery thus palliates his apostasy
and falsehood.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The prejudices of the Baronet were strong in proportion as
they were irrational. I resolved rather to humour than to thwart
them. I contrived to be invited to dine in company with him;
I always proposed the health of the minister, I introduced
politics and defended the Tory party in long speeches, I attended
clubs and public dinners of that interest. I do not know whether
this conduct was justifiable; it may certainly be excused when
the circumstances of my case are duly considered. I would tear
myself in pieces if I suspected that I could be guilty of the
slightest falsehood or prevarication; (see Lord Chesterfield’s
Letters for the courtier-like distinction between simulation and
dissimulation,) but there was nothing of that sort here. I was
of no party, consequently, I could not be accused of deserting
any one. I did not defend the injustice of any body of men, I
did not detract from the merits of any virtuous character. I
praised what was laudable in the Tory party, and blamed what
was reprehensible in the Whigs: I was silent with regard to
whatever was culpable in the former or praiseworthy in the
latter. The stratagem was innocent which injured no one, and
which promoted the happiness of two individuals, especially of
the most amiable woman the world ever knew.”</p>
</div>

<p>An instance of more deplorable perversity of the human
understanding we do not recollect ever to have witnessed.
It almost persuades us to believe that scepticism or indifference
concerning certain sacred truths may occasionally
produce a subtlety of sophism, by which the
conscience of the criminal may be bribed to overlook
his crime.</p>

<p>Towards the conclusion of this strange and powerful
performance it must be confessed that <i>aliquando bonus
dormitat Homerus</i>. The adventure of the Eleutheri,<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_395">[Pg 395]</span><a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
although the sketch of a profounder project, is introduced
and concluded with unintelligible abruptness.
Bruhle dies, purposely as it should seem that his pupil
may renounce the romantic sublimity of his nature, and
that his inauspicious union and prostituted character
might be exempt from the censure of violated friendship.
Numerous indications of profound and vigorous
thought are scattered over even the most negligently
compacted portions of the narrative. It is an unweeded
garden where nightshade is interwoven with
sweet jessamine, and the most delicate spices of the
east peep over struggling stalks of rank and poisonous
hemlock.</p>

<p>In the delineation of the more evanescent feelings
and uncommon instances of strong and delicate passion
we conceive the author to have exhibited new and unparalleled
powers. He has noticed some peculiarities
of female character with a delicacy and truth singularly
exquisite. We think that the interesting subject of
sexual relations requires for its successful development
the application of a mind thus organised and endowed.
Yet even here how great the deficiencies; this mind must
be pure from the fashionable superstitions of gallantry,
must be exempt from the sordid feelings which with
blind idolatry worship the image and blaspheme the
deity, reverence the type, and degrade the reality of which
it is an emblem.</p>

<p>We do not hesitate to assert that the author of this
volume is a man of ability. His great though indisciplinable
energies and fervid rapidity of conception
embody scenes and situations, and passions<span class="pagenum" id="V2_Page_396">[Pg 396]</span> affording
inexhaustible food for wonder and delight. The interest
is deep and irresistible. A moral enchanter seems to
have conjured up the shapes of all that is beautiful
and strange to suspend the faculties in fascination and
astonishment.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
